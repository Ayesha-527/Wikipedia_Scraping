Cryptography,Cryptography or cryptology from Ancient Greek romanized krypts hidden secret and graphein to write or logia study respectively is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior More generally cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics computer science information security electrical engineering digital signal processing physics and others Core concepts related to information security data confidentiality data integrity authentication and nonrepudiation are also central to cryptography Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce chipbased payment cards digital currencies computer passwords and military communications Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption converting readable information plaintext to unintelligible nonsense text ciphertext which can only be read by reversing the process decryption The sender of an encrypted coded message shares the decryption decoding technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice or A for the sender Bob or B for the intended recipient and Eve or E for the eavesdropping adversary Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary While it is theoretically possible to break into a welldesigned system it is infeasible in actual practice to do so Such schemes if well designed are therefore termed computationally secure Theoretical advances eg improvements in integer factorization algorithms and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and if necessary adapted Informationtheoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power such as the onetime pad are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age Cryptographys potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media Terminology The first use of the term cryptograph as opposed to cryptogram dates back to the 19th centuryoriginating from The GoldBug a story by Edgar Allan PoeUntil modern times cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption which is the process of converting ordinary information called plaintext into an unintelligible form called ciphertext Decryption is the reverse in other words moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext A cipher or cypher is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a key The key is a secret ideally known only to the communicants usually a string of characters ideally short so it can be remembered by the user which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext In formal mathematical terms a cryptosystem is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts finite possible cyphertexts finite possible keys and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key Keys are important both formally and in actual practice as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless or even counterproductive for most purposes Historically ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks There are two main types of cryptosystems symmetric and asymmetric In symmetric systems the only ones known until the 1970s the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and a related private key to decrypt it The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key In practice asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key Examples of asymmetric systems include DiffieHellman key exchange RSA RivestShamirAdleman ECC Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Postquantum cryptography Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES Advanced Encryption Standard which replaced the older DES Data Encryption Standard Insecure symmetric algorithms include childrens language tangling schemes such as Pig Latin or other cant and all historical cryptographic schemes however seriously intended prior to the invention of the onetime pad early in the 20th century In colloquial use the term code is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning However in cryptography code has a more specific meaning the replacement of a unit of plaintext ie a meaningful word or phrase with a code word for example wallaby replaces attack at dawn A cypher in contrast is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level a letter a syllable or a pair of letters etc in order to produce a cyphertext Cryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so ie it is the study of how to crack encryption algorithms or their implementations Some use the terms cryptography and cryptology interchangeably in English while others including US military practice generally use cryptography to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and cryptology to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis English is more flexible than several other languages in which cryptology done by cryptologists is always used in the second sense above RFC 2828 advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptologyThe study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology eg frequency data letter combinations universal patterns etc is called cryptolinguistics Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications History Before the modern era cryptography focused on message confidentiality ie encryptionconversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge namely the key needed for decryption of that message Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications such as those of spies military leaders and diplomats In recent decades the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking senderreceiver identity authentication digital signatures interactive proofs and secure computation among others Classic cryptography The main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers which rearrange the order of letters in a message eg hello world becomes ehlol owrdl in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme and substitution ciphers which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters eg fly at once becomes gmz bu podf by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt c 1900 BCE but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information The Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers eg the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military Steganography ie hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential was also first developed in ancient times An early example from Herodotus was a message tattooed on a slaves shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink microdots and digital watermarks to conceal information In India the 2000yearold Kamasutra of Vtsyyana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya In the Kautiliyam the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations such as vowels becoming consonants In the Mulavediya the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal onesIn Sassanid Persia there were two secret scripts according to the Muslim author Ibn alNadim the hdabrya literally Kings script which was used for official correspondence and the rzsaharya which was used to communicate secret messages with other countriesDavid Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods AlKhalil 717786 wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels Ciphertexts produced by a classical cipher and some modern ciphers will reveal statistical information about the plaintext and that information can often be used to break the cipher After the discovery of frequency analysis perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath AlKindi also known as Alkindus in the 9th century nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today though mostly as puzzles see cryptogram AlKindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj alMuamma Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques Language letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution For those ciphers language letter group or ngram frequencies may provide an attack Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467 though there is some indication that it was already known to AlKindi Albertis innovation was to use different ciphers ie substitution alphabets for various parts of a message perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention In the Vigenre cipher a polyalphabetic cipher encryption uses a key word which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used In the mid19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenre cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich KasiskiAlthough frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers encryption has still often been effective in practice as many a wouldbe cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved thus making espionage bribery burglary defection etc more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a ciphers algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security in fact it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme including ciphers should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffss Principle alternatively and more bluntly it was restated by Claude Shannon the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography as Shannons Maximthe enemy knows the system Different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher In medieval times other aids were invented such as the cipher grille which was also used for a kind of steganography With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Albertis own cipher disk Johannes Trithemius tabula recta scheme and Thomas Jeffersons wheel cypher not publicly known and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900 Many mechanical encryptiondecryption devices were invented early in the 20th century and several patented among them rotor machinesfamously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI Early computerera cryptography Cryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering devices proved to be both difficult and laborious In the United Kingdom cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitive tasks such as military code breaking decryption This culminated in the development of the Colossus the worlds first fully electronic digital programmable computer which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Armys Lorenz SZ4042 machine Extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent beginning in the mid1970s In the early 1970s IBM personnel designed the Data Encryption Standard DES algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the United States In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published the DiffieHellman key exchange algorithm In 1977 the RSA algorithm was published in Martin Gardners Scientific American column Since then cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications computer networks and computer security generally Some modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure The onetime pad is one and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions For example the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that RSA is secure and some other systems but even so proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open In practice these are widely used and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers There are systems similar to RSA such as one by Michael O Rabin that are provably secure provided factoring n pq is impossible it is quite unusable in practice The discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure and again there are related less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problemAs well as being aware of cryptographic history cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs For instance continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of bruteforce attacks so when specifying key lengths the required key lengths are similarly advancing The potential impact of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing postquantum cryptography The announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative Modern cryptography Prior to the early 20th century cryptography was mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns Since then cryptography has broadened in scope and now makes extensive use of mathematical subdisciplines including information theory computational complexity statistics combinatorics abstract algebra number theory and finite mathematics Cryptography is also a branch of engineering but an unusual one since it deals with active intelligent and malevolent opposition other kinds of engineering eg civil or chemical engineering need deal only with neutral natural forces There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics Just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis it made possible much more complex ciphers Furthermore computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts this was new and significant Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography both for cipher design and cryptanalysis Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences sometimes in groups or blocks unlike classical and mechanical schemes which generally manipulate traditional characters ie letters and digits directly However computers have also assisted cryptanalysis which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity Nonetheless good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient ie fast and requiring few resources such as memory or CPU capability while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible Modern cryptography Symmetrickey cryptography Symmetrickey cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key or less commonly in which their keys are different but related in an easily computable way This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976 Symmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters the input form used by a stream cipher The Data Encryption Standard DES and the Advanced Encryption Standard AES are block cipher designs that have been designated cryptography standards by the US government though DESs designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted Despite its deprecation as an official standard DES especially its stillapproved and much more secure tripleDES variant remains quite popular it is used across a wide range of applications from ATM encryption to email privacy and secure remote access Many other block ciphers have been designed and released with considerable variation in quality Many even some designed by capable practitioners have been thoroughly broken such as FEALStream ciphers in contrast to the block type create an arbitrarily long stream of key material which is combined with the plaintext bitbybit or characterbycharacter somewhat like the onetime pad In a stream cipher the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material RC4 is a widely used stream cipher Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers by generating blocks of a keystream in place of a Pseudorandom number generator and applying an XOR operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystreamMessage authentication codes MACs are much like cryptographic hash functions except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms and so has been thought worth the effort Cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm They take a message of any length as input and output a short fixedlength hash which can be used in for example a digital signature For good hash functions an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash MD4 is a longused hash function that is now broken MD5 a strengthened variant of MD4 is also widely used but broken in practice The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5like hash functions SHA0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew SHA1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5 but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it the SHA2 family improves on SHA1 but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011 and the US standards authority thought it prudent from a security perspective to develop a new standard to significantly improve the robustness of NISTs overall hash algorithm toolkit Thus a hash function design competition was meant to select a new US national standard to be called SHA3 by 2012 The competition ended on October 2 2012 when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA3 hash algorithm Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security Publickey cryptography Symmetrickey cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely Each distinct pair of communicating parties must ideally share a different key and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret In a groundbreaking 1976 paper Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of publickey also more generally called asymmetric key cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are useda public key and a private key A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key the private key is computationally infeasible from the other the public key even though they are necessarily related Instead both keys are generated secretly as an interrelated pair The historian David Kahn described publickey cryptography as the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the RenaissanceIn publickey cryptosystems the public key may be freely distributed while its paired private key must remain secret In a publickey encryption system the public key is used for encryption while the private or secret key is used for decryption While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system they showed that publickey cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the DiffieHellman key exchange protocol a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key The X509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificatesDiffie and Hellmans publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical publickey encryption system This race was finally won in 1978 by Ronald Rivest Adi Shamir and Len Adleman whose solution has since become known as the RSA algorithmThe DiffieHellman and RSA algorithms in addition to being the first publicly known examples of highquality publickey algorithms have been among the most widely used Other asymmetrickey algorithms include the CramerShoup cryptosystem ElGamal encryption and various elliptic curve techniquesA document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ a British intelligence organization revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments Reportedly around 1970 James H Ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography In 1973 Clifford Cocks invented a solution that was very similar in design rationale to RSA In 1974 Malcolm J Williamson is claimed to have developed the DiffieHellman key exchange Publickey cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature schemes A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce but difficult for anyone else to forge Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed they cannot then be moved from one document to another for any attempt will be detectable In digital signature schemes there are two algorithms one for signing in which a secret key is used to process the message or a hash of the message or both and one for verification in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature RSA and DSA are two of the most popular digital signature schemes Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes eg SSLTLS many VPNs etcPublickey algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of hard problems often from number theory For example the hardness of RSA is related to the integer factorization problem while DiffieHellman and DSA are related to the discrete logarithm problem The security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems most publickey algorithms involve operations such as modular multiplication and exponentiation which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers especially with typical key sizes As a result publickey cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems in which a fast highquality symmetrickey encryption algorithm is used for the message itself while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message but encrypted using a publickey algorithm Similarly hybrid signature schemes are often used in which a cryptographic hash function is computed and only the resulting hash is digitally signed Cryptographic hash functions Cryptographic hash functions are functions that take a variablelength input and return a fixedlength output which can be used in for example a digital signature For a hash function to be secure it must be difficult to compute two inputs that hash to the same value collision resistance and to compute an input that hashes to a given output preimage resistance MD4 is a longused hash function that is now broken MD5 a strengthened variant of MD4 is also widely used but broken in practice The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5like hash functions SHA0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew SHA1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5 but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it the SHA2 family improves on SHA1 but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011 and the US standards authority thought it prudent from a security perspective to develop a new standard to significantly improve the robustness of NISTs overall hash algorithm toolkit Thus a hash function design competition was meant to select a new US national standard to be called SHA3 by 2012 The competition ended on October 2 2012 when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA3 hash algorithm Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security Cryptanalysis The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme thus permitting its subversion or evasion It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs Claude Shannon proved that the onetime pad cipher is unbreakable provided the key material is truly random never reused kept secret from all possible attackers and of equal or greater length than the message Most ciphers apart from the onetime pad can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher In such cases effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required ie work factor in Shannons terms is beyond the ability of any adversary This means it must be shown that no efficient method as opposed to the timeconsuming brute force method can be found to break the cipher Since no such proof has been found to date the onetimepad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher Although wellimplemented onetimepad encryption cannot be broken traffic analysis is still possible There are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks and they can be classified in any of several ways A common distinction turns on what Eve an attacker knows and what capabilities are available In a ciphertextonly attack Eve has access only to the ciphertext good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertextonly attacks In a knownplaintext attack Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext or to many such pairs In a chosenplaintext attack Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext perhaps many times an example is gardening used by the British during WWII In a chosenciphertext attack Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts Finally in a maninthemiddle attack Eve gets in between Alice the sender and Bob the recipient accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient Also important often overwhelmingly so are mistakes generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved Cryptanalysis of symmetrickey ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher For example a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions trying approximately half of the possible keys to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found But this may not be enough assurance a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts with their corresponding ciphertexts and approximately 243 DES operations This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks Publickey algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems The most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithms both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time P using only a classical Turingcomplete computer Much publickey cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P that can solve these problems or using other technologies such as quantum computers For instance the bestknown algorithms for solving the elliptic curvebased version of discrete logarithm are much more timeconsuming than the bestknown algorithms for factoring at least for problems of more or less equivalent size Thus to achieve an equivalent strength of encryption techniques that depend upon the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers such as the RSA cryptosystem require larger keys than elliptic curve techniques For this reason publickey cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid1990s While pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices and are called sidechannel attacks If a cryptanalyst has access to for example the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character they may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information this is known as traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary Poor administration of a cryptosystem such as permitting too short keys will make any system vulnerable regardless of other virtues Social engineering and other attacks against humans eg bribery extortion blackmail espionage rubberhose cryptanalysis or torture are usually employed due to being more costeffective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin Cryptographic primitives Much of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitivesalgorithms with basic cryptographic propertiesand their relationship to other cryptographic problems More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives These primitives provide fundamental properties which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols which guarantee one or more highlevel security properties Note however that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems is quite arbitrary for example the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem and sometimes a primitive Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions oneway functions etc Cryptosystems One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm called a cryptographic system or cryptosystem Cryptosystems eg ElGamal encryption are designed to provide particular functionality eg public key encryption while guaranteeing certain security properties eg chosenplaintext attack CPA security in the random oracle model Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the systems security properties As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems In many cases the cryptosystems structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space eg between the sender of a secure message and its receiver or across time eg cryptographically protected backup data Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols Some widely known cryptosystems include RSA Schnorr signature ElGamal encryption and Pretty Good Privacy PGP More complex cryptosystems include electronic cash systems signcryption systems etc Some more theoretical cryptosystems include interactive proof systems like zeroknowledge proofs and systems for secret sharing Lightweight cryptography Lightweight cryptography LWC concerns cryptographic algorithms developed for a strictly constrained environment The growth of Internet of Things IoT has spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithms that are better suited for the environment An IoT environment requires strict constraints on power consumption processing power and security Algorithms such as PRESENT AES and SPECK are examples of the many LWC algorithms that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Applications Cryptography is widely used on the internet to help protect userdata and prevent eavesdropping To ensure secrecy during transmission many systems use private key cryptography to protect transmitted information With publickey systems one can maintain secrecy without a master key or a large number of keys But some algorithms like Bitlocker and Veracrypt are generally not privatepublic key cryptography For example Veracrypt uses a password hash to generate the single private key However it can be configured to run in publicprivate key systems The C opensource encryption library OpenSSL provides free and opensource encryption software and tools The most commonly used encryption cipher suit is AES as it has hardware acceleration for all x86 based processors that has AESNI A close contender is ChaCha20Poly1305 which is a stream cipher however it is commonly used for mobile devices as they are ARM based which does not feature AESNI instruction set extension Cybersecurity Cryptography can be used to secure communications by encrypting them Websites use encryption via HTTPS Endtoend encryption where only sender and receiver can read messages is implemented for email in Pretty Good Privacy and for secure messaging in general in WhatsApp Signal and TelegramOperating systems use encryption to keep passwords secret conceal parts of the system and ensure that software updates are truly from the system maker Instead of storing plaintext passwords computer systems store hashes thereof then when a user logs in the system passes the given password through a cryptographic hash function and compares it to the hashed value on file In this manner neither the system nor an attacker has at any point access to the password in plaintextEncryption is sometimes used to encrypt ones entire drive For example University College London has implemented BitLocker a program by Microsoft to render drive data opaque without users logging in Cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics Cryptographic techniques enable cryptocurrency technologies such as distributed ledger technologies eg blockchains which finance cryptoeconomics applications such as decentralized finance DeFi Key cryptographic techniques that enable cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics include but are not limited to cryptographic keys cryptographic hash function asymmetric public key encryption MultiFactor Authentication MFA EndtoEnd Encryption E2EE and Zero Knowledge Proofs ZKP Legal issues Prohibitions Cryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies Secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous Because of its facilitation of privacy and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters Accordingly there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to highquality cryptography possible In some countries even the domestic use of cryptography is or has been restricted Until 1999 France significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically though it has since relaxed many of these rules In China and Iran a license is still required to use cryptography Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus Kazakhstan Mongolia Pakistan Singapore Tunisia and VietnamIn the United States cryptography is legal for domestic use but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security many Western governments have at some point strictly regulated export of cryptography After World War II it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas in fact encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List Until the development of the personal computer asymmetric key algorithms ie public key techniques and the Internet this was not especially problematic However as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available highquality encryption techniques became well known around the globe Export controls In the 1990s there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography After the source code for Philip Zimmermanns Pretty Good Privacy PGP encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991 a complaint by RSA Security then called RSA Data Security Inc resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI though no charges were ever filed Daniel J Bernstein then a graduate student at UC Berkeley brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds The 1995 case Bernstein v United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States ConstitutionIn 1996 thirtynine countries signed the Wassenaar Arrangement an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and dualuse technologies such as cryptography The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short keylengths 56bit for symmetric encryption 512bit for RSA would no longer be exportcontrolled Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000 there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in USexported massmarket software Since this relaxation in US export restrictions and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include USsourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers eg via Transport Layer Security The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook Email client programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS and can send and receive email encrypted with SMIME Many Internet users do not realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally do not find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality so even when such laws are in force actual enforcement is often effectively impossible NSA involvement Another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography DES was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s According to Steven Levy IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis but kept the technique secret at the NSAs request The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir rediscovered and announced it some years later The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have Another instance of the NSAs involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptographycontrol initiative Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons The cipher algorithm called Skipjack was then classified declassified in 1998 long after the Clipper initiative lapsed The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffss Principle as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement ie wiretapping Digital rights management Cryptography is central to digital rights management DRM a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders In 1998 US President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA which criminalized all production dissemination and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology now known or later discovered specifically those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization memberstates The United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some but the law nonetheless remains a controversial one Niels Ferguson a wellrespected cryptography researcher has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA Cryptologist Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lockin while inhibiting actual measures toward cybersecurity Both Alan Cox longtime Linux kernel developer and Edward Felten and some of his students at Princeton have encountered problems related to the Act Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia where the work was legal In 2007 the cryptographic keys responsible for Bluray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet In both cases the Motion Picture Association of America sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech Forced disclosure of encryption keys In the United Kingdom the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys Failure to comply is an offense in its own right punishable on conviction by a twoyear jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act the first in 2009 resulted in a term of 13 months imprisonment Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia Finland France and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation In the United States the federal criminal case of United States v Fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password The Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF argued that this is a violation of the protection from selfincrimination given by the Fifth Amendment In 2012 the court ruled that under the All Writs Act the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the courtIn many jurisdictions the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear The 2016 FBIApple encryption dispute concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected As a potential countermeasure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data for example such as that of a drive which has been securely wiped See also Collision attack Comparison of cryptography

Network Security,Network security consists of the policies processes and practices adopted to prevent detect and monitor unauthorized access misuse modification or denial of a computer network and networkaccessible resources Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network which is controlled by the network administrator Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority Network security covers a variety of computer networks both public and private that are used in everyday jobs conducting transactions and communications among businesses government agencies and individuals Networks can be private such as within a company and others which might be open to public access Network security is involved in organizations enterprises and other types of institutions It does as its title explains it secures the network as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done The most common and simple way of protecting a network resource is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password Network security concept Network security starts with authentication commonly with a username and a password Since this requires just one detail authenticating the user nameie the passwordthis is sometimes termed onefactor authentication With twofactor authentication something the user has is also used eg a security token or dongle an ATM card or a mobile phone and with threefactor authentication something the user is is also used eg a fingerprint or retinal scan Once authenticated a firewall enforces access policies such as what services are allowed to be accessed by the network users Though effective to prevent unauthorized access this component may fail to check potentially harmful content such as computer worms or Trojans being transmitted over the network Antivirus software or an intrusion prevention system IPS help detect and inhibit the action of such malware An anomalybased intrusion detection system may also monitor the network like wireshark traffic and may be logged for audit purposes and for later highlevel analysis Newer systems combining unsupervised machine learning with full network traffic analysis can detect active network attackers from malicious insiders or targeted external attackers that have compromised a user machine or accountCommunication between two hosts using a network may be encrypted to maintain security and privacy Honeypots essentially decoy networkaccessible resources may be deployed in a network as surveillance and earlywarning tools as the honeypots are not normally accessed for legitimate purposes Honeypots are placed at a point in the network where they appear vulnerable and undefended but they are actually isolated and monitored Techniques used by the attackers that attempt to compromise these decoy resources are studied during and after an attack to keep an eye on new exploitation techniques Such analysis may be used to further tighten security of the actual network being protected by the honeypot A honeypot can also direct an attackers attention away from legitimate servers A honeypot encourages attackers to spend their time and energy on the decoy server while distracting their attention from the data on the real server Similar to a honeypot a honeynet is a network set up with intentional vulnerabilities Its purpose is also to invite attacks so that the attackers methods can be studied and that information can be used to increase network security A honeynet typically contains one or more honeypotsPrevious research on network security was mostly about using tools to secure transactions and information flow and how well users knew about and used these tools However more recently the discussion has expanded to consider information security in the broader context of the digital economy and society This indicates that its not just about individual users and tools its also about the larger culture of information security in our digital world Security management Security management for networks is different for all kinds of situations A home or small office may only require basic security while large businesses may require highmaintenance and advanced software and hardware to prevent malicious attacks from hacking and spamming In order to minimize susceptibility to malicious attacks from external threats to the network corporations often employ tools which carry out network security verifications Types of attack Networks are subject to attacks from malicious sources Attacks can be from two categories Passive when a network intruder intercepts data traveling through the network and Active in which an intruder initiates commands to disrupt the networks normal operation or to conduct reconnaissance and lateral movements to find and gain access to assets available via the networkTypes of attacks include Passive Network Wiretapping Passive Port scanner Idle scan Encryption Traffic analysis Active Virus Eavesdropping Data modification See also References Further reading Case Study Network Clarity Archived 20160527 at

Cybersecurity,Computer security cybersecurity digital security or information technology security IT security is the protection of computer systems and networks from attacks by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure theft of or damage to hardware software or data as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provideThe field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and WiFi Also due to the growth of smart devices including smartphones televisions and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things IoT Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern largescale systems with farreaching physical effects such as power distribution elections and finance Vulnerabilities and attacks A vulnerability is a weakness in design implementation operation or internal control of a computer or system Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE database An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists Vulnerabilities can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tools or customized scriptsVarious people or parties are vulnerable to cyber attacks however different groups are likely to experience different types of attacks more than othersIn April 2023 the United Kingdom Department for Science Innovation Technology realised a report on cyber attacks over the last 12 months They surveyed 2263 UK businesses 1174 UK registered charities and 554 education institutions The research found that 32 of businesses and 24 of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months This figures were much higher for medium businesses 59 large businesses 69 and highincome charities with 500000 or more in annual income 56 Yet although medium or large businesses are more often the victims since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize businesses SMBs have also become increasing vulnerable as they often do not have advanced tools to defend the business SMBs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attacks and Denialof Service DoS AttacksNormal people working for a business or simply using the internet are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyber attacks These are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices services or users as possible They do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the Internet These strategies mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanningTo secure a computer system it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories Backdoor A backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls These weaknesses may exist for many reasons including original design or poor configuration Due to the nature of backdoors they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals Backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons However criminals often use malware to install backdoors giving them remote administrative access to a system Once they have access cybercriminals can modify files steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computerBackdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who has access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer Denialofservice attack Denial of service attacks DoS are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users Attackers can deny service to individual victims such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many forms of Distributed denial of service DDoS attacks are possible where the attack comes from a large number of points and defending is much more difficult Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques including distributed reflective denial of service DRDoS where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim With such attacks the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks see the attacker motivation section Directaccess attacks A directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gains physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or to steal information Attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications installing software worms keyloggers covert listening devices or using wireless microphones Even when the system is protected by standard security measures these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CDROM or other bootable media Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks Direct service attackers are related in concept to direct memory attacks that allows an attacker to gain direct access to a computers memory The attacks take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allow certain devices such as external hard drives graphics cards or network cards to access the computers memory directlyTo help prevent these attacks computer users must ensure that they have a strong passwords that their computer is locked at all times when they are not using it and that they keep their computer with them at all times when traveling Eavesdropping Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between hosts on a network It typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited Data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods Unlike malware directaccess attacks or other forms of cyber attacks eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices making them difficult to notice In fact the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all He or she can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined timeUsing a virtual private network VPN which encrypts data between two points is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping Using the best form of encryption possible for wireless networks is best practice as well as using HTTPS instead of unencrypted HTTPPrograms such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers Even machines that operate as a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks Malware Malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users Once present on a computer it can leak sensitive details such as personal information business information and passwords can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently Another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victims machine encrypts their files and then turns around and demands a ransom usually in Bitcoin to return that data to the userTypes of malware include some of the following Viruses are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijacks software with the intension to do damage and spread copies of itself Copies are made with the aim to spread to other programs on a computer Worms are similar to viruses however viruses can only function when a user runs opens a comprised program Worms therefore are selfreplicating malware that spread between programs apps and devices without the need for human interaction Trojan horses are programs that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick users into installing them Once installed a RAT remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device Spyware is a type of malware that secretly gathers information on an infected computers and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker One of the most common forms of spyware are known as keyloggers which is a kind of malware which recorders all of a users keyboard inputskeystrokes used to allow hackers to harvest usernames passwords bank account and credit card numbers Scareware as the name suggests is a form of malware which uses social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying or installing unwanted software These attacks often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device has a virus Multivector polymorphic attacks Surfacing in 2017 a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threats combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread Multivector polymorphic attacks as the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic Firstly they are a singular offensive that involves multiple methods of attack In this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the Web email and applications However they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network The attacks can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses worms or trojans constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defences Phishing Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames passwords and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one The fake website often asks for personal information such as login details and passwords This information can then be used to gain access to the individuals real account on the real website Preying on a victims trust phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts A common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices to individuals showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized A more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverages personal or organizationspecific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source Spearphishing attacks target specific individuals rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts Privilege escalation Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privileges or access level For example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system The severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amounts of data Privilege escalation usually starts with social engineering techniques often phishingPrivilege escalation can be separated into to strategies horizontal and vertical privilege escalation Horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gains access to a normal user account that has relatively lowlevel privileges This may be through stealing the users username and password Once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of users at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege Vertical escalation however targets people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such as an employee in IT with a higher privilege Using this privileged account will then enable to attacker to invade other accounts Sidechannel attack Any computational system affects its environment in some form This effect it has on its environment includes a wide range of criteria which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequence make a Cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation faults that allow for access and or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible In Sidechannel attack scenarios the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure Social engineering Social engineering in the context of computer security aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords card numbers etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer This generally involves exploiting peoples trust and relying on their cognitive biases A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action One of the main techniques of social engineering are phishing attacks In early 2016 the FBI reported that such business email compromise BEC scams had cost US businesses more than 2 billion in about two yearsIn May 2016 the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the teams president Peter Feigin resulting in the handover of all the teams employees 2015 W2 tax forms Spoofing Spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such as an IP address or username in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain Spoofing is closely related to phishing There are several types of spoofing including Email spoofing is where an attacker forges the sending From or source address of an email IP address spoofing where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system MAC spoofing where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control MAC address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose as another Biometric spoofing where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user Address Resolution Protocol ARP spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their Media Access Control address with a different hosts IP address This causes data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended hostIn 2018 the cybersecurity firm Trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry Tampering Tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data An intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system components of systems its intended behavior or data Socalled Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples HTML smuggling HTML smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular HTML or web page HTML files can carry payloads concealed as benign inert data in order to defeat content filters These payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filterWhen a target user opens the HTML the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the targets device Information security culture Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization Information security culture is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kindsAndersson and Reimers 2014 found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organizations information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes Indeed the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2020 which examined 3950 security breaches discovered 30 of cybersecurity incidents involved internal actors within a company Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change authors commented Its a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance To manage the information security culture five steps should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation Preevaluation To identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies Strategic planning To come up with a better awareness program clear targets need to be set Assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it Operative planning A good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program Implementation Four stages should be used to implement the information security culture They areCommitment of the management Communication with organizational members Courses for all organizational members Commitment of the employeesPostevaluation To assess the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved areas of concern Computer protection countermeasures In computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be takenSome common countermeasures are listed in the following sections Security by design Security by design or alternately secure by design means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure In this case security is considered a main feature The UK governments National Cyber Security Centre separate secure cyber design principles into five sections Before a secure system is created or updated companies should ensure they understand the fundamentals and the context around the system they are trying to create and to identify any apart weaknesses in a system Companies should design and centre their security around techniques and defences which make attacking their data or systems inherently more challenging for attackers Companies should ensure that their core services that rely on technology are protected so that the technology is always available Although systems can be created which are safe against a multitude of attacks that does not mean that attacks will not be attempted Despite ones security all companies systems should aim to be able to detect and spot attacks as soon as they occur to ensure the most effective response to them Companies should create secure systems designed so that any attack that is successful has a loss severityThese design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques The principle of least privilege where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function That way even if an attacker gains access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system Automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems Code reviews and unit testing approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible Defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds Default secure settings and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering Ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure Audit trails track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined Storing audit trails remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruders from covering their tracks Full disclosure of all vulnerabilities to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered Security architecture Security architecture can be defined as the practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals These goals have overlap with the principles of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise In practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new changes are safe and meet the security requirements of the organisationSimilarly Techopedia defines security architecture as a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment It also specifies when and where to apply security controls The design process is generally reproducible The key attributes of security architecture are the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other determination of controls based on risk assessment good practices finances and legal matters the standardization of controlsPracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business IT and security concerns in an organization Security measures A state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of the three processes threat prevention detection and response These processes are based on various policies and system components which include the following Limiting the access of individuals using user account access controls and using cryptography can protect systems files and data respectively Firewalls are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can if properly configured shield access to internal network services and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering Firewalls can be both hardware and softwarebased Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network Intrusion Detection System IDS products are designed to detect network attacks inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trails and logs serve a similar function for individual systems Response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of legal authorities counterattacks and the like In some special cases the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected Cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threats and attacks Forward web proxy solutions can prevent the client to visit malicious web pages and inspect the content before downloading to the client machinesToday computer security consists mainly of preventive measures like firewalls or an exit procedure A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such as the Internet They can be implemented as software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most UNIXbased operating systems such as Linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking Another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the Internet Some organizations are turning to big data platforms such as Apache Hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threatsIn order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known as the CIA triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security To achieve those objectives administrative physical and technical security measures should be employed The amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known Vulnerability management Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities especially in software and firmware Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities such as open ports insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware In order for these tools to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release Typically these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently Beyond vulnerability scanning many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular penetration tests against their systems to identify vulnerabilities In some sectors this is a contractual requirement Reducing vulnerabilities The act of assessing and reducing vulnerabilities to cyber attacks is commonly referred to as information technology security assessments They aims to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities While formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible it is not yet common Operating systems formally verified include seL4 and SYSGOs PikeOS but these make up a very small percentage of the market It is possible to reduce an attackers chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates andor hiring people with expertise in security Large companies with significant threats can hire Security Operations Centre SOC Analysts These are specialists in cyber defences with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating reports of any new issues and preparing and testing disaster recovery plansWhilst no measures can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measures can help mitigate the damage of possible attacks The effects of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance Outside of formal assessments there are various methods of reducing vulnerabilities Two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information It requires something you know a password or PIN and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access Protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attacks can only be occur by noncomputer means which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving peoples knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing peoples awareness of threats However even in highly disciplined environments eg military organizations social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent Inoculation derived from inoculation theory seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts Hardware protection mechanisms Hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to softwareonly computer security Using devices and methods such as dongles trusted platform modules intrusionaware cases drive locks disabling USB ports and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised Each of these is covered in more detail below USB dongles are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other devices software The dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such as Advanced Encryption Standard AES provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing webbased content such as cloud software or Virtual Private Networks VPNs In addition a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer Trusted platform modules TPMs secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices through the use of microprocessors or socalled computersonachip TPMs used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices preventing unauthorized network and data access Computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives making them inaccessible to thieves Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices like camera GPS removable storage etc that are not in use Mobileenabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones Builtin capabilities such as Bluetooth the newer Bluetooth low energy LE nearfield communication NFC on noniOS devices and biometric validation such as thumbprint readers as well as QR code reader software designed for mobile devices offer new secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings IOMMUs allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of components in mobile and desktop computers by utilizing direct memory access protections Physical Unclonable Functions PUFs can be used as a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuits and hardware providing users the ability to secure the hardware supply chains going into their systems Secure operating systems One use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems Using secure operating systems is a good way of ensuring computer security These are systems that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluations are Common Criteria CC Secure coding In software engineering secure coding aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure Such systems are secure by design Beyond this formal verification aims to prove the correctness of the algorithms underlying a system important for cryptographic protocols for example Capabilities and access control lists Within computer systems two of the main security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists ACLs and rolebased access control RBAC An accesscontrol list ACL with respect to a computer file system is a list of permissions associated with an object An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects as well as what operations are allowed on given objects Rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees and can implement mandatory access control MAC or discretionary access control DAC A further approach capabilitybased security has been mostly restricted to research operating systems Capabilities can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design An opensource project in the area is the E language User security training The enduser is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than 90 of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management sending emails containing sensitive data and attachments to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments A common mistake that users make is saving their user idpassword in their browsers to make it easier to log in to banking sites This is a gift to attackers who have obtained access to a machine by some means The risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authenticationAs the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all levels not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats The focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks Digital hygiene Related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and as the analogy with personal hygiene shows is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimize the risks from cyber threats The assumption is that good cyber hygiene practices can give networked users another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attacks or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks Cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military termThe most common acts of digitalcyber hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backups passwords and ensuring restricted admin rights and network firewalls As opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threats cyber hygiene mostly regards routine measures that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education It can be thought of as an abstract list of tips or measures that have been demonstrated as having a positive effect on personal andor collective digital security As such these measures can be performed by laypeople not just security experts Cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene as computer viruses relate to biological viruses or pathogens However while the term computer virus was coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer viruses the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps as late as 2000 by Internet pioneer Vint Cerf It has since been adopted by the Congress and Senate of the United States the FBI EU institutions and heads of state Difficulty of responding to breaches Responding to attempted security breaches is often very difficult for a variety of reasons including Identifying attackers is difficult as they may operate through proxies temporary anonymous dialup accounts wireless connections and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction If they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete logs to cover their tracks The sheer number of attempted attacks often by automated vulnerability scanners and computer worms is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each Law enforcement officers often lack the skills interest or budget to pursue attackers In addition the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries which may be difficult or timeconsuming to obtainWhere an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdictions now have in place mandatory security breach notification laws Types of security and privacy Systems at risk The growth in the number of computer systems and the increasing reliance upon them by individuals businesses industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk Financial systems The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the US Securities and Exchange Commission SWIFT investment banks and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers brokerage accounts and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchases or selling the information on the black market Instore payment systems and ATMs have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and PINs The UCLA Internet Report Surveying the Digital Future 2000 found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users were somewhat or very concerned about credit card securityThe most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named SSL Secure Sockets Layer and its successor TLS Transport Layer Security identity management and authentication services and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce Several versions of SSL and TLS are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and VoIP voiceoverIP There are various interoperable implementations of these technologies including at least one implementation that is open source Open source allows anyone to view the applications source code and look for and report vulnerabilities The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard cooperated to develop the secure EMV chip which is embedded in credit cards Further developments include the Chip Authentication Program where banks give customers handheld card readers to perform online secure transactions Other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as Instant Issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue onthespot credit cards to interested customers Utilities and industrial equipment Computers control functions at many utilities including coordination of telecommunications the power grid nuclear power plants and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable In 2014 the Computer Emergency Readiness Team a division of the Department of Homeland Security investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies Aviation The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore There is also potential for attack from within an aircraftIn Europe with the PanEuropean Network Service and NewPENS and in the US with the NextGen program air navigation service providers are moving to create their own dedicated networks Many modern passports are now biometric passports containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name gender and date of birth In addition more countries are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud The introduction of the ePassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing Plans are under way in the US the UK and Australia to introduce SmartGate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology The airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets etickets These have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines Longdistance bus companies are also switching over to eticketing transactions today The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outages loss of aircraft and even loss of life Consumer devices Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target Smartphones tablet computers smart watches and other mobile devices such as quantified self devices like activity trackers have sensors such as cameras microphones GPS receivers compasses and accelerometers which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information WiFi Bluetooth and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breachThe increasing number of home automation devices such as the Nest thermostat are also potential targets Healthcare Today many healthcare providers and health insurance companies use the internet to provide enhanced products and services for example through use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness trackers to lower insurance premiums The health care company Humana partners with WebMD Oracle Corporation EDS and Microsoft to enable its members to access their health care records as well as to provide an overview of health care plans Patient records are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse networks alleviating the need for extra storage space Large corporations Large corporations are common targets In many cases attacks are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breaches Examples include the loss of millions of clients credit card and financial details by Home Depot Staples Target Corporation and EquifaxMedical records have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patients to obtain prescription drugs for recreational purposes or resale Although cyber threats continue to increase 62 of all organizations did not increase security training for their business in 2015Not all attacks are financially motivated however security firm HBGary Federal had a serious series of attacks in 2011 from hacktivist group Anonymous in retaliation for the firms CEO claiming to have infiltrated their group and Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014 with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leaks and crippling the company by wiping workstations and servers Automobiles Vehicles are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brakes seat belt tensioners door locks airbags and advanced driverassistance systems on many models Additionally connected cars may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network Selfdriving cars are expected to be even more complex All of these systems carry some security risks and such issues have gained wide attentionSimple examples of risk include a malicious compact disc being used as an attack vector and the cars onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping However if access is gained to a cars internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized 2015 test hackers remotely carjacked a vehicle from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditchManufacturers are reacting in numerous ways with Tesla in 2016 pushing out some security fixes over the air into its cars computer systems In the area of autonomous vehicles in September 2016 the United States Department of Transportation announced some initial safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policiesAdditionally eDrivers licenses are being developed using the same technology For example Mexicos licensing authority ICV has used a smart card platform to issue the first eDrivers licenses to the city of Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Len Shipping Shipping companies have adopted RFID Radio Frequency Identification technology as an efficient digitally secure tracking device Unlike a barcode RFID can be read up to 20 feet away RFID is used by FedEx and UPS Government Government and military computer systems are commonly attacked by activists and foreign powers Local and regional government infrastructure such as traffic light controls police and intelligence agency communications personnel records as well as student recordsThe FBI CIA and Pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their buildings However the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world More and more companies are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology GEs ACUVision for example offers a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording Internet of things and physical vulnerabilities The Internet of things IoT is the network of physical objects such as devices vehicles and buildings that are embedded with electronics software sensors and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data Concerns have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenges involvedWhile the IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems it also provides opportunities for misuse In particular as the Internet of Things spreads widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat If a front doors lock is connected to the Internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone People could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by IoTenabled devices Thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent nonInternetconnected hotel door locksAn attack that targets physical infrastructure andor human lives is sometimes referred to as a cyberkinetic attack As IoT devices and appliances gain currency cyberkinetic attacks can become pervasive and significantly damaging Medical systems Medical devices have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerabilities demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted devices including pacemakers and insulin pumps There are many reports of hospitals and hospital organizations getting hacked including ransomware attacks Windows XP exploits viruses and data breaches of sensitive data stored on hospital servers On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internetconnected devices but no structure for enforcement Energy sector In distributed generation systems the risk of a cyber attack is real according to Daily Energy Insider An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources DER Authority within the city with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility Pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand The DC proposal however would allow thirdparty vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid Telecommunications Perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the SIM Subscriber Identity Module card a device that is embedded in most of the worlds cellular devices before any service can be obtained The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment The Smart Card Web Servers draft standard SCWS defines the interfaces to an HTTP server in a smart card Tests are being conducted to secure OTA overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone Combination SIMDVD devices are being developed through Smart Video Card technology which embeds a DVDcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular SIM card Other telecommunication developments involving digital security include mobile signatures which use the embedded SIM card to generate a legally binding electronic signature Cost and impact of security breaches Serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from 13 billion worms and viruses only to 226 billion for all forms of covert attacks The reliability of these estimates is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotalHowever reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions According to the classic GordonLoeb Model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach Attacker motivation As with physical security the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers Some are thrillseekers or vandals some are activists others are criminals looking for financial gain Statesponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as Markus Hess who hacked for the KGB as recounted by Clifford Stoll in The Cuckoos Egg Attackers motivations can vary for all types of attacks from pleasure to for political goals For example hacktivists may target a company a company or organisation that carries out activities they do not agree with This would be to create bad publicity for the company by having its website crash High capability hackers often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demands of their financial backers These attacks are more likely to attempt more serious attack An example of a more serious attack was the 2015 Ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of files and denialofservice attacks to carry out the full attackAdditionally recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas The growth of the internet mobile technologies and inexpensive computing devices have led to a rise in capabilities but also to the risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations All critical targeted environments are susceptible to compromise and this has led to a series of proactive studies on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivations by these types of actors Several stark differences exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actors seeking to attack based on an ideological preferenceA standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system and who might be motivated to breach it The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured A home personal computer bank and classified military network face very different threats even when the underlying technologies in use are similar Computer security incident management Computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business as usual Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities restore services and processes and minimize losses Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organizations response to a cyberattack Without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles processes and procedures during an escalation slowing the organizations response and resolution There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan Preparation Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises Detection and analysis Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident Containment eradication and recovery Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains Post incident activity Post mortem analysis of the incident its root cause and the organizations response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts Notable attacks and breaches Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below Robert Morris and the first computer worm In 1988 60000 computers were connected to the Internet and most were mainframes minicomputers and professional workstations On 2 November 1988 many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers the first internet computer worm The software was traced back to 23yearold Cornell University graduate student Robert Tappan Morris who said he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet Rome Laboratory In 1994 over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory the US Air Forces main command and research facility Using trojan horses hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Romes networking systems and remove traces of their activities The intruders were able to obtain classified files such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Goddard Space Flight Center WrightPatterson Air Force Base some Defense contractors and other private sector organizations by posing as a trusted Rome center user TJX customer credit card details In early 2007 American apparel and home goods company TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion and that the hackers had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transactions Stuxnet attack In 2010 the computer worm known as Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of Irans nuclear centrifuges It did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controllers PLCs in a targeted attack This is generally believed to have been launched by Israel and the United States to disrupt Irans nuclear program although neither has publicly admitted this Global surveillance disclosures In early 2013 documents provided by Edward Snowden were published by The Washington Post and The Guardian exposing the massive scale of NSA global surveillance There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a NIST standard for encryption This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between Googles data centers Target and Home Depot breaches A Ukrainian hacker known as Rescator broke into Target Corporation computers in 2013 stealing roughly 40 million credit cards and then Home Depot computers in 2014 stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers Warnings were delivered at both corporations but ignored physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting says Jim Walter director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing Office of Personnel Management data breach In April 2015 the Office of Personnel Management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately 215 million personnel records handled by the office The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States Data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers names dates and places of birth addresses and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers Ashley Madison breach In July 2015 a hacker group is known as The Impact Team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison created by Avid Life Media The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well After the breach The Impact Team dumped emails from the companys CEO to prove their point and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently When Avid Life Media did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed files one 97GB and the second 20GB After the second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned but the website remained to function Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack In June 2021 the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the US and led to shortages across the East Coast Legal issues and global regulation International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature There is no global base of common rules to judge and eventually punish cybercrimes and cybercriminals and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute Proving attribution for cybercrimes and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies Computer viruses switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operations like this So the Internet is as if someone had given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world The use of techniques such as dynamic DNS fast flux and bullet proof servers add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement Role of government The role of the government is to make regulations to force companies and organizations to protect their systems infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national powergridThe governments regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated For some cyberspace was seen as a virtual space that was to remain free of government intervention as can be seen in many of todays libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussionsMany government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem R Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco he believes that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation If the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through On the other hand executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently Daniel R McCarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political orderOn 22 May 2020 the UN Security Council held its second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenges to international peace According to UN SecretaryGeneral Antnio Guterres new technologies are too often used to violate rights International actions Many different teams and organizations exist including The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams FIRST is the global association of CSIRTs The USCERT ATT Apple Cisco McAfee Microsoft are all members of this international team The Council of Europe helps protect societies worldwide from the threat of cybercrime through the Convention on Cybercrime The purpose of the Messaging AntiAbuse Working Group MAAWG is to bring the messaging industry together to work collaboratively and to successfully address the various forms of messaging abuse such as spam viruses denialofservice attacks and other messaging exploitations France Telecom Facebook ATT Apple Cisco Sprint are some of the members of the MAAWG ENISA The European Network and Information Security Agency ENISA is an agency of the European Union with the objective to improve network and information security in the European Union Europe On 14 April 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR The GDPR which came into force on 25 May 2018 grants individuals within the European Union EU and the European Economic Area EEA the right to the protection of personal data The regulation requires that any entity that processes personal data incorporate data protection by design and by default It also requires that certain organizations appoint a Data Protection Officer DPO National actions Computer emergency response teams Most countries have their own computer emergency response team to protect network security Canada Since 2010 Canada has had a cybersecurity strategy This functions as a counterpart document to the National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure The strategy has three main pillars securing government systems securing vital private cyber systems and helping Canadians to be secure online There is also a Cyber Incident Management Framework to provide a coordinated response in the event of a cyber incidentThe Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre CCIRC is responsible for mitigating and responding to threats to Canadas critical infrastructure and cyber systems It provides support to mitigate cyber threats technical support to respond recover from targeted cyber attacks and provides online tools for members of Canadas critical infrastructure sectors It posts regular cybersecurity bulletins operates an online reporting tool where individuals and organizations can report a cyber incidentTo inform the general public on how to protect themselves online Public Safety Canada has partnered with STOPTHINKCONNECT a coalition of nonprofit private sector and government organizations and launched the Cyber Security Cooperation Program They also run the GetCyberSafe portal for Canadian citizens and Cyber Security Awareness Month during OctoberPublic Safety Canada aims to begin an evaluation of Canadas cybersecurity strategy in early 2015 Australia Australian federal government announced an 182 million investment to fortify the cybersecurity resilience of small and medium enterprises SMEs and enhance their capabilities in responding to cyber threats This financial backing is an integral component of the soontobeunveiled 20232030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy slated for release within the current week A substantial allocation of 72 million is earmarked for the establishment of a voluntary cyber health check program facilitating businesses in conducting a comprehensive and tailored selfassessment of their cybersecurity upskill This avantgarde health assessment serves as a diagnostic tool enabling enterprises to ascertain the robustness of Australias cyber security regulations Furthermore it affords them access to a repository of educational resources and materials fostering the acquisition of skills necessary for an elevated cybersecurity posture This groundbreaking initiative was jointly disclosed by Minister for Cyber Security Clare ONeil and Minister for Small Business Julie Collins America The United States has its first fully formed cyber plan in 15 years as a result of the release of this National Cyber plan In this policy the US says it will Protect the country by keeping networks systems functions and data safe Promote American wealth by building a strong digital economy and encouraging strong domestic innovation Peace and safety should be kept by making it easier for the US to stop people from using computer tools for bad things working with friends and partners to do this and Increase the United States impact around the world to support the main ideas behind an open safe reliable and compatible Internet The new US cyber strategy seeks to allay some of those concerns by promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace urging nations to adhere to a set of norms both through international law and voluntary standards It also calls for specific measures to harden US government networks from attacks like the June 2015 intrusion into the US Office of Personnel Management OPM which compromised the records of about 42 million current and former government employees And the strategy calls for the US to continue to name and shame bad cyber actors calling them out publicly for attacks when possible along with the use of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure India Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy framework by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology MeitY which aims to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyberattacks and safeguard information such as personal information of web users financial and banking information and sovereign data CERT In is the nodal agency which monitors the cyber threats in the country The post of National Cyber Security Coordinator has also been created in the Prime Ministers Office PMO The Indian Companies Act 2013 has also introduced cyber law and cybersecurity obligations on the part of Indian directors Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000 Update in 2013 South Korea Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013 when the government news media television stations and bank websites were compromised the national government committed to the training of 5000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017 The South Korean government blamed its northern counterpart for these attacks as well as incidents that occurred in 2009 2011 and 2012 but Pyongyang denies the accusations United States Legislation The 1986 18 USC 1030 the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the key legislation It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of protected computers as defined in 18 USC 1030e2 Although various other measures have been proposed none has succeeded In 2013 executive order 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was signed which prompted the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework In response to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14028 on May 12 2021 to increase software security standards for sales to the government tighten detection and security on existing systems improve information sharing and training establish a Cyber Safety Review Board and improve incident response Standardized government testing services The General Services Administration GSA has standardized the penetration test service as a prevetted support service to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities and stop adversaries before they impact US federal state and local governments These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services HACS Agencies The Department of Homeland Security has a dedicated division responsible for the response system risk management program and requirements for cybersecurity in the United States called the National Cyber Security Division The division is home to USCERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructureThe third priority of the FBI is to Protect the United States against cyberbased attacks and hightechnology crimes and they along with the National White Collar Crime Center NW3C and the Bureau of Justice Assistance BJA are part of the multiagency task force The Internet Crime Complaint Center also known as IC3In addition to its own specific duties the FBI participates alongside nonprofit organizations such as InfraGardThe Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS operates in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division The CCIPS is in charge of investigating computer crime and intellectual property crime and is specialized in the search and seizure of digital evidence in computers and networks In 2017 CCIPS published A Framework for a Vulnerability Disclosure Program for Online Systems to help organizations clearly describe authorized vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct thereby substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal violation of law under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030The United States Cyber Command also known as USCYBERCOM has the mission to direct synchronize and coordinate cyberspace planning and operations to defend and advance national interests in collaboration with domestic and international partners It has no role in the protection of civilian networksThe US Federal Communications Commissions role in cybersecurity is to strengthen the protection of critical communications infrastructure to assist in maintaining the reliability of networks during disasters to aid in swift recovery after and to ensure that first responders have access to effective communications servicesThe Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance for medical devices and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is concerned with automotive cybersecurity After being criticized by the Government Accountability Office and following successful attacks on airports and claimed attacks on airplanes the Federal Aviation Administration has devoted funding to securing systems on board the planes of private manufacturers and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System Concerns have also been raised about the future Next Generation Air Transportation SystemThe US Department of Defense DoD issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004 supplemented by DoD Directive 8140 requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology IT certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge skills and abilities KSA Andersson and Reimers 2019 report these certifications range from CompTIAs A and Security through the ICS2orgs CISSP etc Computer emergency readiness team Computer emergency response team is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents In the US two distinct organizations exist although they do work closely together USCERT part of the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security CERTCC created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and run by the Software Engineering Institute SEI US NRC 10 CFR 7354 Cybersecurity In the context of US nuclear power plants the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC outlines cybersecurity requirements under 10 CFR Part 73 specifically in 7354 This section mandates that licensees provide high assurance against cyber attacks for digital equipment and computers and communications systems related to safety security emergency preparedness and support systems Licensees must submit a cybersecurity plan establish a comprehensive cybersecurity program and implement defenseindepth strategies to protect against cyber threats The plan must also include incident response and recovery measures ie Contingency Plans Contingency Plans for Power Grid for cyber attacks Details can be found in 10 CFR 7354 Protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks NEI 0809 Cybersecurity Plan for Nuclear Power Plants The Nuclear Energy Institutes NEI 0809 document Security Plan for Nuclear Power Reactors outlines a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity in the nuclear power industry Drafted with input from the US NRC this guideline is instrumental in aiding licensees to comply with Title 10 Part 73 Section 7354 10 CFR 7354 of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR which mandates robust protection of digital computers and equipment and communications systems at nuclear power plants against cyber threats NEI 0809 provides a structured approach to cybersecurity encompassing aspects such as the creation of a cyber security plan implementation of technical and management security controls and integration of these plans into the overall physical protection programs eg Physical Security Programs and other general Nuclear Security Programs in place at nuclear facilities It emphasizes a defenseindepth strategy employing layered security measures to safeguard critical digital assets CDAs ie critical assets businesscritical assets safetycritical assets from cyber attacks thereby ensuring the safety and integrity of nuclear power operations Refer to NEI 0809 for more details Modern warfare There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare As Mark Clayton from The Christian Science Monitor wrote in a 2015 article titled The New Cyber Arms Race In the future wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities transportation communications and energy Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops the path of jet fighters the command and control of warships This has led to new terms such as cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism The United States Cyber Command was created in 2009 and many other countries have similar forces There are a few critical voices that question whether cybersecurity is as significant a threat as it is made out to be Careers Cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of IT concerned with reducing organizations risk of hack or data breaches According to research from the Enterprise Strategy Group 46 of organizations say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skills in 2016 up from 28 in 2015 Commercial government and nongovernmental organizations all employ cybersecurity professionals The fastest increases in demand for cybersecurity workers are in industries managing increasing volumes of consumer data such as finance health care and retail However the use of the term cybersecurity is more prevalent in government job descriptionsTypical cybersecurity job

awarenessraising training and audits Security ConsultantSpecialistIntelligence Broad titles that encompass any one or all of the other roles or titles tasked with protecting computers networks software data or information systems against viruses worms spyware malware intrusion detection unauthorized access denialofservice attacks and an everincreasing list of attacks by hackers acting as individuals or as part of organized crime or foreign governmentsStudent programs are also available for people interested in beginning a career in cybersecurity Meanwhile a flexible and effective option for information security professionals of all experience levels to keep studying is online security training including webcasts A wide range of certified courses are also availableIn the United Kingdom a nationwide set of cybersecurity forums known as the UK Cyber Security Forum were established supported by the Governments cybersecurity strategy in order to encourage startups and innovation and to address the skills gap identified by the UK Government In Singapore the Cyber Security Agency has issued a Singapore Operational Technology OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework OTCCF The framework defines emerging cybersecurity roles in Operational Technology The OTCCF was endorsed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority IMDA It outlines the different OT cybersecurity job positions as well as the technical skills and core competencies necessary It also depicts the many career paths available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunities Terminology The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below Access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems These systems can protect either the whole computer such as through an interactive login screen or individual services such as a FTP server There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users such as passwords identification cards smart cards and biometric systems Antivirus software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software malware Applications are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block users the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignments to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing as few as possible They are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patches or updates for them For example programs can be installed into an individual users account which limits the programs potential access as well as being a means control which users have specific exceptions to policy In Linux FreeBSD OpenBSD and other Unixlike operating systems there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other means of restricting the application to its own sandbox For example Linux provides namespaces and Cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resources Generalized security frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor help administrators control access Java and other languages which compile to Java byte code and run in the Java virtual machine can have their access to other applications controlled at the virtual machine level Some software can be run in software containers which can even provide their own set of system libraries limiting the softwares or anyone controlling it access to the servers versions of the libraries Authentication techniques can be used to ensure that communication endpoints are who they say they are Automated theorem proving and other verification tools can be used to enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications Backups are one or more copies kept of important computer files Typically multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copies will still exist Capability and access control list techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control Capabilities vs ACLs discusses their use Chain of trust techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the systems designers Confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person Cryptographic techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems reducing the probability that the data exchange between systems can be intercepted or modified Cyberwarfare is an Internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems Such attacks can for example disable official websites and networks disrupt or disable essential services steal or alter classified data and cripple financial systems Data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data recordEncryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible Symmetrickey ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys and publickey encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance Endpoint security software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops mobile devices and USB drives Firewalls serve as a gatekeeper system between networks allowing only traffic that matches defined rules They often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features They are nearuniversal between company local area networks and the Internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured A hacker is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network Honey pots are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques Intrusiondetection systems are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations A microkernel is an approach to operating system design which has only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers protocol stacks and file systems in the safer less privileged user space Pinging The standard ping application can be used to test if an IP address is in use If it is attackers may then try a port scan to detect which services are exposed A port scan is used to probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications A key logger is spyware that silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user types on the computers keyboard Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security Logic bombs is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific event Zero trust security means that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resources on the network History Since the Internets arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years the notion of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives Cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 60 years of technological change In the 1970s and 1980s computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of the Internet where with increased connectivity computer viruses and network intrusions began to take off After the spread of viruses in the 1990s the 2000s marked the institutionalization of organized attacks such as distributed denial of service This led to the formalization of cybersecurity as a professional disciplineThe April 1967 session organized by Willis Ware at the Spring Joint Computer Conference and the later publication of the Ware Report were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security Wares work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concernsA 1977 NIST publication introduced the CIA triad of confidentiality integrity and availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals While still relevant many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposedHowever in the 1970s and 1980s there were no grave computer threats because computers and the internet were still developing and security threats were easily identifiable More often threats came from malicious insiders who gained unauthorized access to sensitive documents and files Although malware and network breaches existed during the early years they did not use them for financial gain By the second half of the 1970s established computer firms like IBM started offering commercial access control systems and computer security software productsOne of the earliest examples of an attack on a computer network was the computer worm Creeper written by Bob Thomas at BBN which propagated through the ARPANET in 1971 The program was purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload A later program Reaper was created by Ray Tomlinson in 1972 and used to destroy CreeperBetween September 1986 and June 1987 a group of German hackers performed the first documented case of cyber espionage The group hacked into American defense contractors universities and military base networks and sold gathered information to the Soviet KGB The group was led by Markus Hess who was arrested on 29 June 1987 He was convicted of espionage along with two coconspirators on 15 Feb 1990 In 1988 one of the first computer worms called the Morris worm was distributed via the Internet It gained significant mainstream media attentionIn 1993 Netscape started developing the protocol SSL shortly after the National Center for Supercomputing Applications NCSA launched Mosaic 10 the first web browser in 1993 Netscape had SSL version 10 ready in 1994 but it was never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerabilities These weaknesses included replay attacks and a vulnerability that allowed hackers to alter unencrypted communications sent by users However in February 1995 Netscape launched Version 20The National Security Agency NSA is responsible for the protection of US information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence The agency analyzes commonly used software and system configurations to find security flaws which it can use for offensive purposes against competitors of the United StatesNSA contractors created and sold clickandshoot attack tools to US agencies and close allies but eventually the tools made their way to foreign adversaries In 2016 NSAs own hacking tools were hacked and they have been used by Russia and North Korea NSAs employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries anxious to compete in cyberwarfare In 2007 the United States and Israel began exploiting security flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in Iran to refine nuclear materials Iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability which it began using against the United States Notable scholars See also References Further reading Branch Jordan 24 September 2020 Whats in a Name Metaphors and Cybersecurity International Organization Cambridge University Press CUP

Phishing,Phishing is a form of social engineering and scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as ransomware Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim is navigating the site and transverse any additional security boundaries with the victim As of 2020 it is the most common type of cybercrime with the FBIs Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crimeThe term phishing was first recorded in 1995 in the cracking toolkit AOHell but may have been used earlier in the hacker magazine 2600 It is a variation of fishing and refers to the use of lures to fish for sensitive informationMeasures to prevent or reduce the impact of phishing attacks include legislation user education public awareness and technical security measures The importance of phishing awareness has increased in both personal and professional settings with phishing attacks among businesses rising from 72 to 86 from 2017 to 2020 Types Email phishing Phishing attacks often delivered via email spam attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or login credentials Most attacks are bulk attacks that are not targeted and are instead sent in bulk to a wide audience The goal of the attacker can vary with common targets including financial institutions email and cloud productivity providers and streaming services The stolen information or access may be used to steal money install malware or spear phish others within the target organization Compromised streaming service accounts may also be sold on darknet marketsThis type of social engineering attack can involve sending fraud emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source such as a bank or government agency These messages typically redirect to a fake login page where the user is prompted to enter their login credentials Spear phishing Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack that uses personalized emails to trick a specific individual or organization into believing they are legitimate It often utilizes personal information about the target to increase the chances of success These attacks often target executives or those in financial departments with access to sensitive financial data and services Accountancy and audit firms are particularly vulnerable to spear phishing due to the value of the information their employees have access toThreat Group4127 Fancy Bear targeted Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign with spear phishing attacks on over 1800 Google accounts using the accountsgooglecom domain to threaten targeted usersA study on spear phishing susceptibility among different age groups found that 43 of 100 young and 58 of older users clicked on simulated phishing links in daily emails over 21 days Older women had the highest susceptibility while susceptibility in young users declined over the study but remained stable in older users Whaling and CEO fraud Whaling attacks use spear phishing techniques to target senior executives and other highprofile individuals with customized content often related to a subpoena or customer complaintCEO fraud involves sending fake emails from senior executives to trick employees into sending money to an offshore account It has a low success rate but can result in organizations losing large sums of money Clone phishing Clone phishing is a type of attack where a legitimate email with an attachment or link is copied and modified to contain malicious content The modified email is then sent from a fake address made to look like its from the original sender The attack may appear to be a resend or update of the original email It often relies on the sender or recipient being previously hacked so the attacker can access the legitimate email Voice phishing Voice over IP VoIP is used in vishing or voice phishing attacks where attackers make automated phone calls to large numbers of people often using texttospeech synthesizers claiming fraudulent activity on their accounts The attackers spoof the calling phone number to appear as if it is coming from a legitimate bank or institution The victim is then prompted to enter sensitive information or connected to a live person who uses social engineering tactics to obtain information Vishing takes advantage of the publics lower awareness and trust in voice telephony compared to email phishing SMS phishing SMS phishing or smishing is a type of phishing attack that uses text messages from a cell phone or smartphone to deliver a bait message The victim is usually asked to click a link call a phone number or contact an email address provided by the attacker They may then be asked to provide private information such as login credentials for other websites The difficulty in identifying illegitimate links can be compounded on mobile devices due to the limited display of URLs in mobile browsers Smishing can be just as effective as email phishing as many smartphones have fast internet connectivity Smishing messages may also come from unusual phone numbers Page hijacking Page hijacking involves redirecting users to malicious websites or exploit kits through the compromise of legitimate web pages often using cross site scripting Hackers may insert exploit kits such as MPack into compromised websites to exploit legitimate users visiting the server Page hijacking can also involve the insertion of malicious inline frames allowing exploit kits to load This tactic is often used in conjunction with watering hole attacks on corporate targets Calendar phishing Calendar phishing involves sending fake calendar invitations with phishing links These invitations often mimic common event requests and can easily be added to calendars automatically To protect against this form of fraud former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder recommends changing calendar settings to not automatically add new invitations Quishing QR codes have been used maliciously in phishing attacks The term quishing involves deceiving individuals into thinking a QR code is harmless while the true intent is malicious aiming to access sensitive information Cybercriminals exploit the trust placed in QR codes particularly on mobile phones which are more vulnerable to attacks compared to desktop operating systems Quishing attacks often involve sending QR codes via email enticing users to scan them to verify accounts leading to potential device compromise It is advised to exercise caution and avoid scanning QR codes unless the source is verified Techniques Link manipulation Phishing attacks often involve creating fake links that appear to be from a legitimate organization These links may use misspelled URLs or subdomains to deceive the user In the following example URL httpwwwyourbankexamplecom it can appear to the untrained eye as though the URL will take the user to the example section of the yourbank website actually this URL points to the yourbank ie phishing subdomain section of the example website fraudsters domain name Another tactic is to make the displayed text for a link appear trustworthy while the actual link goes to the phishers site To check the destination of a link many email clients and web browsers will show the URL in the status bar when the mouse is hovering over it However some phishers may be able to bypass this security measureInternationalized domain names IDNs can be exploited via IDN spoofing or homograph attacks to allow attackers to create fake websites with visually identical addresses to legitimate ones These attacks have been used by phishers to disguise malicious URLs using open URL redirectors on trusted websites Even digital certificates such as SSL may not protect against these attacks as phishers can purchase valid certificates and alter content to mimic genuine websites or host phishing sites without SSL Filter evasion Phishers have sometimes used images instead of text to make it harder for antiphishing filters to detect the text commonly used in phishing emails In response more sophisticated antiphishing filters are able to recover hidden text in images using optical character recognition OCR Social engineering Phishing often uses social engineering techniques to trick users into performing actions such as clicking a link or opening an attachment or revealing sensitive information It often involves pretending to be a trusted entity and creating a sense of urgency like threatening to close or seize a victims bank or insurance accountAn alternative technique to impersonationbased phishing is the use of fake news articles to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link These links often lead to fake websites that appear legitimate but are actually run by attackers who may try to install malware or present fake virus notifications to the victim History Early history Early phishing techniques can be traced back to the 1990s when black hat hackers and the warez community used AOL to steal credit card information and commit other online crimes The term phishing is said to have been coined by Khan C Smith a wellknown spammer and hacker and its first recorded mention was found in the hacking tool AOHell which was released in 1995 AOHell allowed hackers to impersonate AOL staff and send instant messages to victims asking them to reveal their passwords In response AOL implemented measures to prevent phishing and eventually shut down the warez scene on their platform 2000s In the 2000s phishing attacks became more organized and targeted The first known direct attempt against a payment system Egold occurred in June 2001 and shortly after the September 11 attacks a post911 id check phishing attack followed The first known phishing attack against a retail bank was reported in September 2003 Between May 2004 and May 2005 approximately 12 million computer users in the United States suffered losses caused by phishing totaling approximately US929 million Phishing was recognized as a fully organized part of the black market and specializations emerged on a global scale that provided phishing software for payment which were assembled and implemented into phishing campaigns by organized gangs The United Kingdom banking sector suffered from phishing attacks with losses from web banking fraud almost doubling in 2005 compared to 2004 In 2006 almost half of phishing thefts were committed by groups operating through the Russian Business Network based in St Petersburg Email scams posing as the Internal Revenue Service were also used to steal sensitive data from US taxpayers Social networking sites are a prime target of phishing since the personal details in such sites can be used in identity theft In 2007 36 million adults lost US32 billion due to phishing attacks The AntiPhishing Working Group reported receiving 115370 phishing email reports from consumers with US and China hosting more than 25 of the phishing pages each in the third quarter of 2009 2010s Phishing in the 2010s saw a significant increase in the number of attacks In 2011 the master keys for RSA SecurID security tokens were stolen through a phishing attack Chinese phishing campaigns also targeted highranking officials in the US and South Korean governments and military as well as Chinese political activists According to Ghosh phishing attacks increased from 187203 in 2010 to 445004 in 2012 In August 2013 Outbrain suffered a spearphishing attack and in November 2013 110 million customer and credit card records were stolen from Target customers through a phished subcontractor account CEO and IT security staff subsequently fired In August 2014 iCloud leaks of celebrity photos were based on phishing emails sent to victims that looked like they came from Apple or Google In November 2014 phishing attacks on ICANN gained administrative access to the Centralized Zone Data System also gained was data about users in the system and access to ICANNs public Governmental Advisory Committee wiki blog and whois information portal Fancy Bear was linked to spearphishing attacks against the Pentagon email system in August 2015 and the group used a zeroday exploit of Java in a spearphishing attack on the White House and NATO Fancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the Democratic National Committee in the first quarter of 2016 In August 2016 members of the Bundestag and political parties such as Linkenfaction leader Sahra Wagenknecht Junge Union and the CDU of Saarland were targeted by spearphishing attacks suspected to be carried out by Fancy Bear In August 2016 the World AntiDoping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA but consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear In 2017 76 of organizations experienced phishing attacks with nearly half of the information security professionals surveyed reporting an increase from 2016 In the first half of 2017 businesses and residents of Qatar were hit with over 93570 phishing events in a threemonth span In August 2017 customers of Amazon faced the Amazon Prime Day phishing attack when hackers sent out seemingly legitimate deals to customers of Amazon When Amazons customers attempted to make purchases using the deals the transaction would not be completed prompting the retailers customers to input data that could be compromised and stolen In 2018 the company blockone which developed the EOSIO blockchain was attacked by a phishing group who sent phishing emails to all customers aimed at intercepting the users cryptocurrency wallet key and a later attack targeted airdrop tokens 2020s Phishing attacks have evolved in the 2020s to include elements of social engineering as demonstrated by the July 15 2020 Twitter breach In this case a 17yearold hacker and accomplices set up a fake website resembling Twitters internal VPN provider used by remote working employees Posing as helpdesk staff they called multiple Twitter employees directing them to submit their credentials to the fake VPN website Using the details supplied by the unsuspecting employees they were able to seize control of several highprofile user accounts including those of Barack Obama Elon Musk Joe Biden and Apple Incs company account The hackers then sent messages to Twitter followers soliciting Bitcoin promising to double the transaction value in return The hackers collected 1286 BTC about 117000 at the time Antiphishing There are antiphishing websites which publish exact messages that have been recently circulating the internet such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messagesAs recently as 2007 the adoption of antiphishing strategies by businesses needing to protect personal and financial information was low Now there are several different techniques to combat phishing including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing These techniques include steps that can be taken by individuals as well as by organizations Phone web site and email phishing can now be reported to authorities as described below User training Effective phishing education including conceptual knowledge and feedback is an important part of any organizations antiphishing strategy While there is limited data on the effectiveness of education in reducing susceptibility to phishing much information on the threat is available onlineSimulated phishing campaigns in which organizations test their employees training by sending fake phishing emails are commonly used to assess their effectiveness One example is a study by the National Library of Medicine in which an organization received 858200 emails during a 1month testing period with 139400 16 being marketing and 18871 2 being identified as potential threats These campaigns are often used in the healthcare industry as healthcare data is a valuable target for hackers These campaigns are just one of the ways that organizations are working to combat phishingTo avoid phishing attempts people can modify their browsing habits and be cautious of emails claiming to be from a company asking to verify an account Its best to contact the company directly or manually type in their website address rather than clicking on any hyperlinks in suspicious emailsNearly all legitimate email messages from companies to their customers contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers Some companies for example PayPal always address their customers by their username in emails so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion Dear PayPal customer it is likely to be an attempt at phishing Furthermore PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoofPayPalcom domain to investigate and warn other customers However it is unsafe to assume that the presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate and some studies have shown that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers but research has shown that people tend to not differentiate between the first and last digits This is an issue because the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution A study on phishing attacks in game environments found that educational games can effectively educate players against information disclosures and can increase awareness on phishing risk thus mitigating risks This an example of how users can be trained through game based models The AntiPhishing Working Group whos one of the largest antiphishing organizations in the world produces regular report on trends in phishing attacksGoogle posted a video demonstrating how to identify and protect yourself from Phishing scams Technical approaches A wide range of technical approaches are available to prevent phishing attacks reaching users or to prevent them from successfully capturing sensitive information Filtering out phishing mail Specialized spam filters can reduce the number of phishing emails that reach their addressees inboxes These filters use a number of techniques including machine learning and natural language processing approaches to classify phishing emails and reject email with forged addresses Browsers alerting users to fraudulent websites Another popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list One such service is the Safe Browsing service Web browsers such as Google Chrome Internet Explorer 7 Mozilla Firefox 20 Safari 32 and Opera all contain this type of antiphishing measure Firefox 2 used Google antiphishing software Opera 91 uses live blacklists from Phishtank cyscon and GeoTrust as well as live whitelists from GeoTrust Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked which has raised concerns about privacy According to a report by Mozilla in late 2006 Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing companyAn approach introduced in mid2006 involves switching to a special DNS service that filters out known phishing domains this will work with any browser and is similar in principle to using a hosts file to block web adverts To mitigate the problem of phishing sites impersonating a victim site by embedding its images such as logos several site owners have altered the images to send a message to the visitor that a site may be fraudulent The image may be moved to a new filename and the original permanently replaced or a server can detect that the image was not requested as part of normal browsing and instead send a warning image Augmenting password logins The Bank of America website is one of several that asks users to select a personal image marketed as SiteKey and displays this userselected image with any forms that request a password Users of the banks online services are instructed to enter a password only when they see the image they selected However several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent In addition this feature like other forms of twofactor authentication is susceptible to other attacks such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005 and Citibank in 2006A similar system in which an automatically generated Identity Cue consisting of a colored word within a colored box is displayed to each website user is in use at other financial institutionsSecurity skins are a related technique that involves overlaying a userselected image onto the login form as a visual cue that the form is legitimate Unlike the websitebased image schemes however the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser and not between the user and the website The scheme also relies on a mutual authentication protocol which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect useronly authentication schemes Still another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt The user must identify the pictures that fit their prechosen categories such as dogs cars and flowers Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website a dynamic imagebased authentication method creates a onetime passcode for the login requires active participation from the user and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the users secret categories Monitoring and takedown Several companies offer banks and other organizations likely to suffer from phishing scams roundtheclock services to monitor analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites Automated detection of phishing content is still below accepted levels for direct action with contentbased analysis reaching between 80 and 90 of success so most of the tools include manual steps to certify the detection and authorize the response Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups such as cyscon or PhishTank Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google Transaction verification and signing Solutions have also emerged using the mobile phone smartphone as a second channel for verification and authorization of banking transactions Multifactor authentication Organizations can implement two factor or multifactor authentication MFA which requires a user to use at least 2 factors when logging in For example a user must both present a smart card and a password This mitigates some risk in the event of a successful phishing attack the stolen password on its own cannot be reused to further breach the protected system However there are several attack methods which can defeat many of the typical systems MFA schemes such as WebAuthn address this issue by design Email content redaction Organizations that prioritize security over convenience can require users of its computers to use an email client that redacts URLs from email messages thus making it impossible for the reader of the email to click on a link or even copy a URL While this may result in an inconvenience it does almost eliminate email phishing attacks Limitations of technical responses An article in Forbes in August 2014 argues that the reason phishing problems persist even after a decade of antiphishing technologies being sold is that phishing is a technological medium to exploit human weaknesses and that technology cannot fully compensate for human weaknessesOrganizational responses Scholars have found that the investment into both technological and organizational factors can impact protection against phishing The studies found that organizations can improve their technical education of employees if they include sociotechnical factors in their training Legal responses On January 26 2004 the US Federal Trade Commission filed the first lawsuit against a Californian teenager suspected of phishing by creating a webpage mimicking America Online and stealing credit card information Other countries have followed this lead by tracing and arresting phishers A phishing kingpin Valdir Paulo de Almeida was arrested in

Computer Virus,A computer virus is a type of malware that when executed replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code into those programs If this replication succeeds the affected areas are then said to be infected with a computer virus a metaphor derived from biological virusesComputer viruses generally require a host program The virus writes its own code into the host program When the program runs the written virus program is executed first causing infection and damage By contrast a computer worm does not need a host program as it is an independent program or code chunk Therefore it is not restricted by the host program but can run independently and actively carry out attacksVirus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus Viruses use complex antidetectionstealth strategies to evade antivirus software Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit eg with ransomware desire to send a political message personal amusement to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software for sabotage and denial of service or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issues artificial life and evolutionary algorithmsAs of 2013 computer viruses caused billions of dollars worth of economic damage each year In response an industry of antivirus software has cropped up selling or freely distributing virus protection to users of various operating systems History The first academic work on the theory of selfreplicating computer programs was done in 1949 by John von Neumann who gave lectures at the University of Illinois about the Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata The work of von Neumann was later published as the Theory of selfreproducing automata In his essay von Neumann described how a computer program could be designed to reproduce itself Von Neumanns design for a selfreproducing computer program is considered the worlds first computer virus and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology In 1972 Veith Risak directly building on von Neumanns work on selfreplication published his article Selbstreproduzierende Automaten mit minimaler Informationsbertragung Selfreproducing automata with minimal information exchange The article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a SIEMENS 400435 computer system In 1980 Jrgen Kraus wrote his Diplom thesis Selbstreproduktion bei Programmen Selfreproduction of programs at the University of Dortmund In his work Kraus postulated that computer programs can behave in a way similar to biological viruses The Creeper virus was first detected on ARPANET the forerunner of the Internet in the early 1970s Creeper was an experimental selfreplicating program written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971 Creeper used the ARPANET to infect DEC PDP10 computers running the TENEX operating system Creeper gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message IM THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN was displayed The Reaper program was created to delete CreeperIn 1982 a program called Elk Cloner was the first personal computer virus to appear in the wildthat is outside the single computer or computer lab where it was created Written in 1981 by Richard Skrenta a ninth grader at Mount Lebanon High School near Pittsburgh it attached itself to the Apple DOS 33 operating system and spread via floppy disk On its 50th use the Elk Cloner virus would be activated infecting the personal computer and displaying a short poem beginning Elk Cloner The program with a personality In 1984 Fred Cohen from the University of Southern California wrote his paper Computer Viruses Theory and Experiments It was the first paper to explicitly call a selfreproducing program a virus a term introduced by Cohens mentor Leonard Adleman In 1987 Fred Cohen published a demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses Fred Cohens theoretical compression virus was an example of a virus which was not malicious software malware but was putatively benevolent wellintentioned However antivirus professionals do not accept the concept of benevolent viruses as any desired function can be implemented without involving a virus automatic compression for instance is available under Windows at the choice of the user Any virus will by definition make unauthorised changes to a computer which is undesirable even if no damage is done or intended The first page of Dr Solomons Virus Encyclopaedia explains the undesirability of viruses even those that do nothing but reproduceAn article that describes useful virus functionalities was published by J B Gunn under the title Use of virus functions to provide a virtual APL interpreter under user control in 1984 The first IBM PC compatible virus in the wild was a boot sector virus dubbed cBrain created in 1986 and was released in 1987 by Amjad Farooq Alvi and Basit Farooq Alvi in Lahore Pakistan reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written The first virus to specifically target Microsoft Windows WinVir was discovered in April 1992 two years after the release of Windows 30 The virus did not contain any Windows API calls instead relying on DOS interrupts A few years later in February 1996 Australian hackers from the viruswriting crew VLAD created the Bizatch virus also known as Boza virus which was the first known virus to target Windows 95 In late 1997 the encrypted memoryresident stealth virus Win32Cabanas was releasedthe first known virus that targeted Windows NT it was also able to infect Windows 30 and Windows 9x hostsEven home computers were affected by viruses The first one to appear on the Amiga was a boot sector virus called SCA virus which was detected in November 1987 Design Parts A computer virus generally contains three parts the infection mechanism which finds and infects new files the payload which is the malicious code to execute and the trigger which determines when to activate the payload Infection mechanism Also called the infection vector this is how the virus spreads Some viruses have a search routine which locate and infect files on disk Other viruses infect files as they are run such as the Jerusalem DOS virus Trigger Also known as a logic bomb this is the part of the virus that determines the condition for which the payload is activated This condition may be a particular date time presence of another program size on disk exceeding a threshold or opening a specific file Payload The payload is the body of the virus that executes the malicious activity Examples of malicious activities include damaging files theft of confidential information or spying on the infected system Payload activity is sometimes noticeable as it can cause the system to slow down or freeze Sometimes payloads are nondestructive and their main purpose is to spread a message to as many people as possible This is called a virus hoax Phases Virus phases is the life cycle of the computer virus described by using an analogy to biology This life cycle can be divided into four phases Dormant phase The virus program is idle during this stage The virus program has managed to access the target users computer or software but during this stage the virus does not take any action The virus will eventually be activated by the trigger which states which event will execute the virus Not all viruses have this stage Propagation phase The virus starts propagating which is multiplying and replicating itself The virus places a copy of itself into other programs or into certain system areas on the disk The copy may not be identical to the propagating version viruses often morph or change to evade detection by IT professionals and antivirus software Each infected program will now contain a clone of the virus which will itself enter a propagation phase Triggering phase A dormant virus moves into this phase when it is activated and will now perform the function for which it was intended The triggering phase can be caused by a variety of system events including a count of the number of times that this copy of the virus has made copies of itself The trigger may occur when an employee is terminated from their employment or after a set period of time has elapsed in order to reduce suspicion Execution phase This is the actual work of the virus where the payload will be released It can be destructive such as deleting files on disk crashing the system or corrupting files or relatively harmless such as popping up humorous or political messages on screen Targets and replication Computer viruses infect a variety of different subsystems on their host computers and software One manner of classifying viruses is to analyze whether they reside in binary executables such as EXE or COM files data files such as Microsoft Word documents or PDF files or in the boot sector of the hosts hard drive or some combination of all of theseA memoryresident virus or simply resident virus installs itself as part of the operating system when executed after which it remains in RAM from the time the computer is booted up to when it is shut down Resident viruses overwrite interrupt handling code or other functions and when the operating system attempts to access the target file or disk sector the virus code intercepts the request and redirects the control flow to the replication module infecting the target In contrast a nonmemoryresident virus or nonresident virus when executed scans the disk for targets infects them and then exits ie it does not remain in memory after it is done executingMany common applications such as Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word allow macro programs to be embedded in documents or emails so that the programs may be run automatically when the document is opened A macro virus or document virus is a virus that is written in a macro language and embedded into these documents so that when users open the file the virus code is executed and can infect the users computer This is one of the reasons that it is dangerous to open unexpected or suspicious attachments in emails While not opening attachments in emails from unknown persons or organizations can help to reduce the likelihood of contracting a virus in some cases the virus is designed so that the email appears to be from a reputable organization eg a major bank or credit card company Boot sector viruses specifically target the boot sector andor the Master Boot Record MBR of the hosts hard disk drive solidstate drive or removable storage media flash drives floppy disks etcThe most common way of transmission of computer viruses in boot sector is physical media When reading the VBR of the drive the infected floppy disk or USB flash drive connected to the computer will transfer data and then modify or replace the existing boot code The next time a user tries to start the desktop the virus will immediately load and run as part of the master boot recordEmail viruses are viruses that intentionally rather than accidentally use the email system to spread While virus infected files may be accidentally sent as email attachments email viruses are aware of email system functions They generally target a specific type of email system Microsoft Outlook is the most commonly used harvest email addresses from various sources and may append copies of themselves to all email sent or may generate email messages containing copies of themselves as attachments Detection To avoid detection by users some viruses employ different kinds of deception Some old viruses especially on the DOS platform make sure that the last modified date of a host file stays the same when the file is infected by the virus This approach does not fool antivirus software however especially those which maintain and date cyclic redundancy checks on file changes Some viruses can infect files without increasing their sizes or damaging the files They accomplish this by overwriting unused areas of executable files These are called cavity viruses For example the CIH virus or Chernobyl Virus infects Portable Executable files Because those files have many empty gaps the virus which was 1 KB in length did not add to the size of the file Some viruses try to avoid detection by killing the tasks associated with antivirus software before it can detect them for example Conficker A Virus may also hide its presence using a rootkit by not showing itself on the list of system processes or by disguising itself within a trusted process In the 2010s as computers and operating systems grow larger and more complex old hiding techniques need to be updated or replaced Defending a computer against viruses may demand that a file system migrate towards detailed and explicit permission for every kind of file access In addition only a small fraction of known viruses actually cause real incidents primarily because many viruses remain below the theoretical epidemic threshold Read request intercepts While some kinds of antivirus software employ various techniques to counter stealth mechanisms once the infection occurs any recourse to clean the system is unreliable In Microsoft Windows operating systems the NTFS file system is proprietary This leaves antivirus software little alternative but to send a read request to Windows files that handle such requests Some viruses trick antivirus software by intercepting its requests to the operating system A virus can hide by intercepting the request to read the infected file handling the request itself and returning an uninfected version of the file to the antivirus software The interception can occur by code injection of the actual operating system files that would handle the read request Thus an antivirus software attempting to detect the virus will either not be permitted to read the infected file or the read request will be served with the uninfected version of the same fileThe only reliable method to avoid stealth viruses is to boot from a medium that is known to be clear Security software can then be used to check the dormant operating system files Most security software relies on virus signatures or they employ heuristics Security software may also use a database of file hashes for Windows OS files so the security software can identify altered files and request Windows installation media to replace them with authentic versions In older versions of Windows file cryptographic hash functions of Windows OS files stored in Windowsto allow file integrityauthenticity to be checkedcould be overwritten so that the System File Checker would report that altered system files are authentic so using file hashes to scan for altered files would not always guarantee finding an infection Selfmodification Most modern antivirus programs try to find viruspatterns inside ordinary programs by scanning them for socalled virus signatures Different antivirus programs will employ different search methods when identifying viruses If a virus scanner finds such a pattern in a file it will perform other checks to make sure that it has found the virus and not merely a coincidental sequence in an innocent file before it notifies the user that the file is infected The user can then delete or in some cases clean or heal the infected file Some viruses employ techniques that make detection by means of signatures difficult but probably not impossible These viruses modify their code on each infection That is each infected file contains a different variant of the virusOne method of evading signature detection is to use simple encryption to encipher encode the body of the virus leaving only the encryption module and a static cryptographic key in cleartext which does not change from one infection to the next In this case the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus code If the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file the only part of the virus that remains constant is the decrypting module which would for example be appended to the end In this case a virus scanner cannot directly detect the virus using signatures but it can still detect the decrypting module which still makes indirect detection of the virus possible Since these would be symmetric keys stored on the infected host it is entirely possible to decrypt the final virus but this is probably not required since selfmodifying code is such a rarity that finding some may be reason enough for virus scanners to at least flag the file as suspicious An old but compact way will be the use of arithmetic operation like addition or subtraction and the use of logical conditions such as XORing where each byte in a virus is with a constant so that the exclusiveor operation had only to be repeated for decryption It is suspicious for a code to modify itself so the code to do the encryptiondecryption may be part of the signature in many virus definitions A simpler older approach did not use a key where the encryption consisted only of operations with no parameters like incrementing and decrementing bitwise rotation arithmetic negation and logical NOT Some viruses called polymorphic viruses will employ a means of encryption inside an executable in which the virus is encrypted under certain events such as the virus scanner being disabled for updates or the computer being rebooted This is called cryptovirology Polymorphic code was the first technique that posed a serious threat to virus scanners Just like regular encrypted viruses a polymorphic virus infects files with an encrypted copy of itself which is decoded by a decryption module In the case of polymorphic viruses however this decryption module is also modified on each infection A wellwritten polymorphic virus therefore has no parts which remain identical between infections making it very difficult to detect directly using signatures Antivirus software can detect it by decrypting the viruses using an emulator or by statistical pattern analysis of the encrypted virus body To enable polymorphic code the virus has to have a polymorphic engine also called mutating engine or mutation engine somewhere in its encrypted body See polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engines operateSome viruses employ polymorphic code in a way that constrains the mutation rate of the virus significantly For example a virus can be programmed to mutate only slightly over time or it can be programmed to refrain from mutating when it infects a file on a computer that already contains copies of the virus The advantage of using such slow polymorphic code is that it makes it more difficult for antivirus professionals and investigators to obtain representative samples of the virus because bait files that are infected in one run will typically contain identical or similar samples of the virus This will make it more likely that the detection by the virus scanner will be unreliable and that some instances of the virus may be able to avoid detection To avoid being detected by emulation some viruses rewrite themselves completely each time they are to infect new executables Viruses that utilize this technique are said to be in metamorphic code To enable metamorphism a metamorphic engine is needed A metamorphic virus is usually very large and complex For example W32Simile consisted of over 14000 lines of assembly language code 90 of which is part of the metamorphic engine Effects Damage is due to causing system failure corrupting data wasting computer resources increasing maintenance costs or stealing personal information Even though no antivirus software can uncover all computer viruses especially new ones computer security researchers are actively searching for new ways to enable antivirus solutions to more effectively detect emerging viruses before they become widely distributedA power virus is a computer program that executes specific machine code to reach the maximum CPU power dissipation thermal energy output for the central processing units Computer cooling apparatus are designed to dissipate power up to the thermal design power rather than maximum power and a power virus could cause the system to overheat if it does not have logic to stop the processor This may cause permanent physical damage Power viruses can be malicious but are often suites of test software used for integration testing and thermal testing of computer components during the design phase of a product or for product benchmarkingStability test applications are similar programs which have the same effect as power viruses high CPU usage but stay under the users control They are used for testing CPUs for example when overclocking Spinlock in a poorly written program may cause similar symptoms if it lasts sufficiently long Different microarchitectures typically require different machine code to hit their maximum power Examples of such machine code do not appear to be distributed in CPU reference materials Infection vectors As software is often designed with security features to prevent unauthorized use of system resources many viruses must exploit and manipulate security bugs which are security defects in a system or application software to spread themselves and infect other computers Software development strategies that produce large numbers of bugs will generally also produce potential exploitable holes or entrances for the virus To replicate itself a virus must be permitted to execute code and write to memory For this reason many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of legitimate programs see code injection If a user attempts to launch an infected program the virus code may be executed simultaneously In operating systems that use file extensions to determine program associations such as Microsoft Windows the extensions may be hidden from the user by default This makes it possible to create a file that is of a different type than it appears to the user For example an executable may be created and named picturepngexe in which the user sees only picturepng and therefore assumes that this file is a digital image and most likely is safe yet when opened it runs the executable on the client machine Viruses may be installed on removable media such as flash drives The drives may be left in a parking lot of a government building or other target with the hopes that curious users will insert the drive into a computer In a 2015 experiment researchers at the University of Michigan found that 4598 percent of users would plug in a flash drive of unknown originThe vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows This is due to Microsofts large market share of desktop computer users The diversity of software systems on a network limits the destructive potential of viruses and malware Opensource operating systems such as Linux allow users to choose from a variety of desktop environments packaging tools etc which means that malicious code targeting any of these systems will only affect a subset of all users Many Windows users are running the same set of applications enabling viruses to rapidly spread among Microsoft Windows systems by targeting the same exploits on large numbers of hostsWhile Linux and Unix in general have always natively prevented normal users from making changes to the operating system environment without permission Windows users are generally not prevented from making these changes meaning that viruses can easily gain control of the entire system on Windows hosts This difference has continued partly due to the widespread use of administrator accounts in contemporary versions like Windows XP In 1997 researchers created and released a virus for Linuxknown as Bliss Bliss however requires that the user run it explicitly and it can only infect programs that the user has the access to modify Unlike Windows users most Unix users do not log in as an administrator or root user except to install or configure software as a result even if a user ran the virus it could not harm their operating system The Bliss virus never became widespread and remains chiefly a research curiosity Its creator later posted the source code to Usenet allowing researchers to see how it workedBefore computer networks became widespread most viruses spread on removable media particularly floppy disks In the early days of the personal computer many users regularly exchanged information and programs on floppies Some viruses spread by infecting programs stored on these disks while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector ensuring that they would be run when the user booted the computer from the disk usually inadvertently Personal computers of the era would attempt to boot first from a floppy if one had been left in the drive Until floppy disks fell out of use this was the most successful infection strategy and boot sector viruses were the most common in the wild for many years Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s driven by the spread of personal computers and the resultant increase in bulletin board system BBS modem use and software sharing Bulletin boarddriven software sharing contributed directly to the spread of Trojan horse programs and viruses were written to infect popularly traded software Shareware and bootleg software were equally common vectors for viruses on BBSs Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by other computersMacro viruses have become common since the mid1990s Most of these viruses are written in the scripting languages for Microsoft programs such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and spread throughout Microsoft Office by infecting documents and spreadsheets Since Word and Excel were also available for Mac OS most could also spread to Macintosh computers Although most of these viruses did not have the ability to send infected email messages those viruses which did take advantage of the Microsoft Outlook Component Object Model COM interface Some old versions of Microsoft Word allow macros to replicate themselves with additional blank lines If two macro viruses simultaneously infect a document the combination of the two if also selfreplicating can appear as a mating of the two and would likely be detected as a virus unique from the parentsA virus may also send a web address link as an instant message to all the contacts eg friends and colleagues email addresses stored on an infected machine If the recipient thinking the link is from a friend a trusted source follows the link to the website the virus hosted at the site may be able to infect this new computer and continue propagating Viruses that spread using crosssite scripting were first reported in 2002 and were academically demonstrated in 2005 There have been multiple instances of the crosssite scripting viruses in the wild exploiting websites such as MySpace with the Samy worm and Yahoo Countermeasures In 1989 The ADAPSO Software Industry Division published Dealing With Electronic Vandalism in which they followed the risk of data loss by the added risk of losing customer confidenceMany users install antivirus software that can detect and eliminate known viruses when the computer attempts to download or run the executable file which may be distributed as an email attachment or on USB flash drives for example Some antivirus software blocks known malicious websites that attempt to install malware Antivirus software does not change the underlying capability of hosts to transmit viruses Users must update their software regularly to patch security vulnerabilities holes Antivirus software also needs to be regularly updated to recognize the latest threats This is because malicious hackers and other individuals are always creating new viruses The German AVTEST Institute publishes evaluations of antivirus software for Windows and AndroidExamples of Microsoft Windows anti virus and antimalware software include the optional Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows XP Vista and Windows 7 for realtime protection the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool now included with Windows Security Updates on Patch Tuesday the second Tuesday of each month and Windows Defender an optional download in the case of Windows XP Additionally several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet usually restricted to noncommercial use Some such free programs are almost as good as commercial competitors Common security vulnerabilities are assigned CVE IDs and listed in the US National Vulnerability Database Secunia PSI is an example of software free for personal use that will check a PC for vulnerable outofdate software and attempt to update it Ransomware and phishing scam alerts appear as press releases on the Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard Ransomware is a virus that posts a message on the users screen saying that the screen or system will remain locked or unusable until a ransom payment is made Phishing is a deception in which the malicious individual pretends to be a friend computer security expert or other benevolent individual with the goal of convincing the targeted individual to reveal passwords or other personal information Other commonly used preventive measures include timely operating system updates software updates careful Internet browsing avoiding shady websites and installation of only trusted software Certain browsers flag sites that have been reported to Google and that have been confirmed as hosting malware by GoogleThere are two common methods that an antivirus software application uses to detect viruses as described in the antivirus software article The first and by far the most common method of virus detection is using a list of virus signature definitions This works by examining the content of the computers memory its Random Access Memory RAM and boot sectors and the files stored on fixed or removable drives hard drives floppy drives or USB flash drives and comparing those files against a database of known virus signatures Virus signatures are just strings of code that are used to identify individual viruses for each virus the antivirus designer tries to choose a unique signature string that will not be found in a legitimate program Different antivirus programs use different signatures to identify viruses The disadvantage of this detection method is that users are only protected from viruses that are detected by signatures in their most recent virus definition update and not protected from new viruses see zeroday attackA second method to find viruses is to use a heuristic algorithm based on common virus behaviors This method can detect new viruses for which antivirus security firms have yet to define a signature but it also gives rise to more false positives than using signatures False positives can be disruptive especially in a commercial environment because it may lead to a company instructing staff not to use the company computer system until IT services have checked the system for viruses This can slow down productivity for regular workers Recovery strategies and methods One may reduce the damage done by viruses by making regular backups of data and the operating systems on different media that are either kept unconnected to the system most of the time as in a hard drive readonly or not accessible for other reasons such as using different file systems This way if data is lost through a virus one can start again using the backup which will hopefully be recent If a backup session on optical media like CD and DVD is closed it becomes readonly and can no longer be affected by a virus so long as a virus or infected file was not copied onto the CDDVD Likewise an operating system on a bootable CD can be used to start the computer if the installed operating systems become unusable Backups on removable media must be carefully inspected before restoration The Gammima virus for example propagates via removable flash drivesMany websites run by antivirus software companies provide free online virus scanning with limited cleaning facilities after all the purpose of the websites is to sell antivirus products and services Some websiteslike Google subsidiary VirusTotalcomallow users to upload one or more suspicious files to be scanned and checked by one or more antivirus programs in one operation Additionally several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet usually restricted to noncommercial use Microsoft offers an optional free antivirus utility called Microsoft Security Essentials a Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool that is updated as part of the regular Windows update regime and an older optional antimalware malware removal tool Windows Defender that has been upgraded to an antivirus product in Windows 8 Some viruses disable System Restore and other important Windows tools such as Task Manager and CMD An example of a virus that does this is CiaDoor Many such viruses can be removed by rebooting the computer entering Windows safe mode with networking and then using system tools or Microsoft Safety Scanner System Restore on Windows Me Windows XP Windows Vista and Windows 7 can restore the registry and critical system files to a previous checkpoint Often a virus will cause a system to hang or freeze and a subsequent hard reboot will render a system restore point from the same day corrupted Restore points from previous days should work provided the virus is not designed to corrupt the restore files and does not exist in previous restore pointsMicrosofts System File Checker improved in Windows 7 and later can be used to check for and repair corrupted system files Restoring an earlier clean virusfree copy of the entire partition from a cloned disk a disk image or a backup copy is one solutionrestoring an earlier backup disk image is relatively simple to do usually removes any malware and may be faster than disinfecting the computeror reinstalling and reconfiguring the operating system and programs from scratch as described below then restoring user preferences Reinstalling the operating system is another approach to virus removal It may be possible to recover copies of essential user data by booting from a live CD or connecting the hard drive to another computer and booting from the second computers operating system taking great care not to infect that computer by executing any infected programs on the original drive The original hard drive can then be reformatted and the OS and all programs installed from original media Once the system has been restored precautions must be taken to avoid reinfection from any restored executable files Popular culture The first known description of a selfreproducing program in fiction is in the 1970 short story The Scarred Man by Gregory Benford which describes a computer program called VIRUS which when installed on a computer with telephone modem dialing capability randomly dials phone numbers until it hits a modem that is answered by another computer and then attempts to program the answering computer with its own program so that the second computer will also begin dialing random numbers in search of yet another computer to program The program rapidly spreads exponentially through susceptible computers and can only be countered by a second program called VACCINE His story was based on an actual computer virus written in FORTRAN that Benford had created and run on the lab computer in the 1960s as a proofofconcept and which he told John Brunner about in 1970The idea was explored further in two 1972 novels When HARLIE Was One by David Gerrold and The Terminal Man by Michael Crichton and became a major theme of the 1975 novel The Shockwave Rider by John BrunnerThe 1973 Michael Crichton scifi film Westworld made an early mention of the concept of a computer virus being a central plot theme that causes androids to run amok Alan Oppenheimers character summarizes the problem by stating that theres a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy to an infectious disease process spreading from onearea to the next To which the replies are stated Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease and I must confess I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery Other malware The term virus is also misused by extension to refer to other types of malware Malware encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software such as computer worms ransomware spyware adware trojan horses keyloggers rootkits bootkits malicious Browser Helper Object BHOs and other malicious software The majority of active malware threats are trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer viruses The term computer virus coined by Fred Cohen in 1985 is a misnomer Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers such as acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit CPU time accessing and stealing private information eg credit card numbers debit card numbers phone numbers names email addresses passwords bank information house addresses etc corrupting data displaying political humorous or threatening messages on the users screen spamming their email contacts logging their keystrokes or even rendering the computer useless However not all viruses carry a destructive payload and attempt to hide themselvesthe defining characteristic of viruses is that they are selfreplicating computer programs that modify other software without user consent by injecting themselves into the said programs similar to a biological virus which replicates within living cells See also Notes References Further reading External links Viruses at Curlie DMOZ Microsoft Security Portal US Govt CERT

Encryption,In cryptography encryption is the process of encoding information This process converts the original representation of the information known as plaintext into an alternative form known as ciphertext Ideally only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a wouldbe interceptor For technical reasons an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudorandom encryption key generated by an algorithm It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but for a welldesigned encryption scheme considerable computational resources and skills are required An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users Historically various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography Early encryption techniques were often used in military messaging Since then new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of publickey and symmetrickey Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption History Ancient One of the earliest forms of encryption is symbol replacement which was first found in the tomb of Khnumhotep II who lived in 1900 BC Egypt Symbol replacement encryption is nonstandard which means that the symbols require a cipher or key to understand This type of early encryption was used throughout Ancient Greece and Rome for military purposes One of the most famous military encryption developments was the Caesar Cipher which was a system in which a letter in normal text is shifted down a fixed number of positions down the alphabet to get the encoded letter A message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the Caesar Cipher Around 800 AD Arab mathematician AlKindi developed the technique of frequency analysis which was an attempt to systematically crack Caesar ciphers This technique looked at the frequency of letters in the encrypted message to determine the appropriate shift This technique was rendered ineffective after the creation of the polyalphabetic cipher by Leon Battista Alberti in 1465 which incorporated different sets of languages In order for frequency analysis to be useful the person trying to decrypt the message would need to know which language the sender chose 19th20th century Around 1790 Thomas Jefferson theorized a cipher to encode and decode messages in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence The cipher known today as the Wheel Cipher or the Jefferson Disk although never actually built was theorized as a spool that could jumble an English message up to 36 characters The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher A similar device to the Jefferson Disk the M94 was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne This device was used in US military communications until 1942In World War II the Axis powers used a more advanced version of the M94 called the Enigma Machine The Enigma Machine was more complex because unlike the Jefferson Wheel and the M94 each day the jumble of letters switched to a completely new combination Each days combination was only known by the Axis so many thought the only way to break the code would be to try over 17000 combinations within 24 hours The Allies used computing power to severely limit the number of reasonable combinations they needed to check every day leading to the breaking of the Enigma Machine Modern Today encryption is used in the transfer of communication over the Internet for security and commerce As computing power continues to increase computer encryption is constantly evolving to prevent eavesdropping attacks With one of the first modern cipher suites DES utilizing a 56bit key with 72057594037927936 possibilities being able to be cracked in 22 hours and 15 minutes by EFFs DES cracker in 1999 which used a bruteforce method of cracking Modern encryption standards often use stronger key sizes often 256 like AES256bit mode TwoFish ChaCha20Poly1305 Serpentconfigurable up to 512bit Cipher suites utilizing a 128bit or higher key like AES will not be able to be bruteforced due to the total amount of keys of 34028237e38 possibilities The most likely option for cracking ciphers with high key size is to find vulnerabilities in the cipher itself like inherent biases and backdoors For example RC4 a stream cipher was cracked due to inherent biases and vulnerabilities in the cipher Encryption in cryptography In the context of cryptography encryption serves as a mechanism to ensure confidentiality Since data may be visible on the Internet sensitive information such as passwords and personal communication may be exposed to potential interceptors The process of encrypting and decrypting messages involves keys The two main types of keys in cryptographic systems are symmetrickey and publickey also known as asymmetrickeyMany complex cryptographic algorithms often use simple modular arithmetic in their implementations Types In symmetrickey schemes the encryption and decryption keys are the same Communicating parties must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication The German Enigma Machine utilized a new symmetrickey each day for encoding and decoding messages In publickey encryption schemes the encryption key is published for anyone to use and encrypt messages However only the receiving party has access to the decryption key that enables messages to be read Publickey encryption was first described in a secret document in 1973 beforehand all encryption schemes were symmetrickey also called privatekey 478 Although published subsequently the work of Diffie and Hellman was published in a journal with a large readership and the value of the methodology was explicitly described The method became known as the DiffieHellman key exchange RSA RivestShamirAdleman is another notable publickey cryptosystem Created in 1978 it is still used today for applications involving digital signatures Using number theory the RSA algorithm selects two prime numbers which help generate both the encryption and decryption keysA publicly available publickey encryption application called Pretty Good Privacy PGP was written in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann and distributed free of charge with source code PGP was purchased by Symantec in 2010 and is regularly updated Uses Encryption has long been used by militaries and governments to facilitate secret communication It is now commonly used in protecting information within many kinds of civilian systems For example the Computer Security Institute reported that in 2007 71 of companies surveyed utilized encryption for some of their data in transit and 53 utilized encryption for some of their data in storage Encryption can be used to protect data at rest such as information stored on computers and storage devices eg USB flash drives In recent years there have been numerous reports of confidential data such as customers personal records being exposed through loss or theft of laptops or backup drives encrypting such files at rest helps protect them if physical security measures fail Digital rights management systems which prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted material and protect software against reverse engineering see also copy protection is another somewhat different example of using encryption on data at restEncryption is also used to protect data in transit for example data being transferred via networks eg the Internet ecommerce mobile telephones wireless microphones wireless intercom systems Bluetooth devices and bank automatic teller machines There have been numerous reports of data in transit being intercepted in recent years Data should also be encrypted when transmitted across networks in order to protect against eavesdropping of network traffic by unauthorized users Data erasure Conventional methods for permanently deleting data from a storage device involve overwriting the devices whole content with zeros ones or other patterns a process which can take a significant amount of time depending on the capacity and the type of storage medium Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous This method is called cryptoshredding An example implementation of this method can be found on iOS devices where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated effaceable storage Because the key is stored on the same device this setup on its own does not offer full privacy or security protection if an unauthorized person gains physical access to the device Limitations Encryption is used in the 21st century to protect digital data and information systems As computing power increased over the years encryption technology has only become more advanced and secure However this advancement in technology has also exposed a potential limitation of todays encryption methods The length of the encryption key is an indicator of the strength of the encryption method For example the original encryption key DES Data Encryption Standard was 56 bits meaning it had 256 combination possibilities With todays computing power a 56bit key is no longer secure being vulnerable to brute force attacksQuantum computing utilizes properties of quantum mechanics in order to process large amounts of data simultaneously Quantum computing has been found to achieve computing speeds thousands of times faster than todays supercomputers This computing power presents a challenge to todays encryption technology For example RSA encryption utilizes the multiplication of very large prime numbers to create a semiprime number for its public key Decoding this key without its private key requires this semiprime number to be factored which can take a very long time to do with modern computers It would take a supercomputer anywhere between weeks to months to factor in this key However quantum computing can use quantum algorithms to factor this semiprime number in the same amount of time it takes for normal computers to generate it This would make all data protected by current publickey encryption vulnerable to quantum computing attacks Other encryption techniques like elliptic curve cryptography and symmetric key encryption are also vulnerable to quantum computingWhile quantum computing could be a threat to encryption security in the future quantum computing as it currently stands is still very limited Quantum computing currently is not commercially available cannot handle large amounts of code and only exists as computational devices not computers Furthermore quantum computing advancements will be able to be utilized in favor of encryption as well The National Security Agency NSA is currently preparing postquantum encryption standards for the future Quantum encryption promises a level of security that will be able to counter the threat of quantum computing Attacks and countermeasures Encryption is an important tool but is not sufficient alone to ensure the security or privacy of sensitive information throughout its lifetime Most applications of encryption protect information only at rest or in transit leaving sensitive data in clear text and potentially vulnerable to improper disclosure during processing such as by a cloud service for example Homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation are emerging techniques to compute on encrypted data these techniques are general and Turing complete but incur high computational andor communication costs In response to encryption of data at rest cyberadversaries have developed new types of attacks These more recent threats to encryption of data at rest include cryptographic attacks stolen ciphertext attacks attacks on encryption keys insider attacks data corruption or integrity attacks data destruction attacks and ransomware attacks Data fragmentation and active defense data protection technologies attempt to counter some of these attacks by distributing moving or mutating ciphertext so it is more difficult to identify steal corrupt or destroy The debate around encryption The question of balancing the need for national security with the right to privacy has been debated for years since encryption has become critical in todays digital society The modern encryption debate started around the 90 when US government tried to ban cryptography because according to them it would threaten national security The debate is polarized around two opposing views Those who see strong encryption as a problem making it easier for criminals to hide their illegal acts online and others who argue that encryption keep digital communications safe The debate heated up in 2014 when Big Tech like Apple and Google set encryption by default in their devices This was the start of a series of controversies that puts governments companies and internet users at stake Integrity protection of ciphertexts Encryption by itself can protect the confidentiality of messages but other techniques are still needed to protect the integrity and authenticity of a message for example verification of a message authentication code MAC or a digital signature usually done by a hashing algorithm or a PGP signature Authenticated encryption algorithms are designed to provide both encryption and integrity protection together Standards for cryptographic software and hardware to perform encryption are widely available but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem A single error in system design or execution can allow successful attacks Sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption See for example traffic analysis TEMPEST or Trojan horseIntegrity protection mechanisms such as MACs and digital signatures must be applied to the ciphertext when it is first created typically on the same device used to compose the message to protect a message endtoend along its full transmission path otherwise any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it Encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself has correct keys and has not been tampered with If an endpoint device has been configured to trust a root certificate that an attacker controls for example then the attacker can both inspect and tamper with encrypted data by performing a maninthemiddle attack anywhere along the messages path The common practice of TLS interception by network operators represents a controlled and institutionally sanctioned form of such an attack but countries have also attempted to employ such attacks as a form of control and censorship Ciphertext length and padding Even when encryption correctly hides a messages content and it cannot be tampered with at rest or in transit a messages length is a form of metadata that can still leak sensitive information about the message For example the wellknown CRIME and BREACH attacks against HTTPS were sidechannel attacks that relied on information leakage via the length of encrypted content Traffic analysis is a broad class of techniques that often employs message lengths to infer sensitive implementation about traffic flows by aggregating information about a large number of messages Padding a messages payload before encrypting it can help obscure the cleartexts true length at the cost of increasing the ciphertexts size and introducing or increasing bandwidth overhead Messages may be padded randomly or deterministically with each approach having different tradeoffs Encrypting and padding messages to form padded uniform random blobs or PURBs is a practice guaranteeing that the cipher text leaks no metadata about its cleartexts content and leaks asymptotically minimal O log log M displaystyle Olog log M information

Secure Coding,Secure coding is the practice of developing computer software in such a way that guards against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities Defects bugs and logic flaws are consistently the primary cause of commonly exploited software vulnerabilities Through the analysis of thousands of reported vulnerabilities security professionals have discovered that most vulnerabilities stem from a relatively small number of common software programming errors By identifying the insecure coding practices that lead to these errors and educating developers on secure alternatives organizations can take proactive steps to help significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in software before deploymentSome scholars have suggested that in order to effectively confront threats related to cybersecurity proper security should be coded or baked in to the systems With security being designed into the software this ensures that there will be protection against insider attacks and reduces the threat to application security Bufferoverflow prevention Buffer overflows a common software security vulnerability happen when a process tries to store data beyond a fixedlength buffer For example if there are 8 slots to store items in there will be a problem if there is an attempt to store 9 items In computer memory the overflowed data may overwrite data in the next location which can result in a security vulnerability stack smashing or program termination segmentation fault An example of a C program prone to a buffer overflow isIf the user input is larger than the destination buffer a buffer overflow will occur To fix this unsafe program use strncpy to prevent a possible buffer overflowAnother secure alternative is to dynamically allocate memory on the heap using mallocIn the above code snippet the program attempts to copy the contents of src into dst while also checking the return value of malloc to ensure that enough memory was able to be allocated for the destination buffer Formatstring attack prevention A Format String Attack is when a malicious user supplies specific inputs that will eventually be entered as an argument to a function that performs formatting such as printf The attack involves the adversary reading from or writing to the stack The C printf function writes output to stdout If the parameter of the printf function is not properly formatted several security bugs can be introduced Below is a program that is vulnerable to a format string attackA malicious argument passed to the program could be sssssss which can crash the program from improper memory reads Integeroverflow prevention Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in an integer too large to be represented within the available space A program which does not properly check for integer overflow introduces potential software bugs and exploits Below is a function in C which attempts to confirm that the sum of x and y is less than or equal to a defined value MAX The problem with the code is it does not check for integer overflow on the addition operation If the sum of x and y is greater than the maximum possible value of an unsigned int the addition operation will overflow and perhaps result in a value less than or equal to MAX even though the sum of x and y is greater than MAX Below is a function which checks for overflow by confirming the sum is greater than or equal to both x and y If the sum did overflow the sum would be less than x or less than y Path traversal prevention Path traversal is a vulnerability whereby paths provided from an untrusted source are interpreted in such a way that unauthorised file access is possible For example consider a script that fetches an article by taking a filename which is then read by the script and parsed Such a script might use the following hypothetical URL to retrieve an article about dog food httpswwwexamplenetcgibinarticleshnamedogfoodhtml If the script has no input checking instead trusting that the filename is always valid a malicious user could forge a URL to retrieve configuration files from the web server httpswwwexamplenetcgibinarticleshnameetcpasswd Depending on the script this may expose the etcpasswd file which on Unixlike systems contains among others user IDs their login names home directory paths and shells See SQL injection for a similar attack See also Application Security Defensive programming Security bug Secure by default Notes References Taylor Art Brian Buege Randy Layman 2006 Hacking Exposed J2EE Java McGrawHill Primis p 426 ISBN 0390599751,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_coding,Short,329,726
Computer Security,Computer security cybersecurity digital security or information technology security IT security is the protection of computer systems and networks from attacks by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure theft of or damage to hardware software or data as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provideThe field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and WiFi Also due to the growth of smart devices including smartphones televisions and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things IoT Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern largescale systems with farreaching physical effects such as power distribution elections and finance Vulnerabilities and attacks A vulnerability is a weakness in design implementation operation or internal control of a computer or system Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE database An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists Vulnerabilities can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tools or customized scriptsVarious people or parties are vulnerable to cyber attacks however different groups are likely to experience different types of attacks more than othersIn April 2023 the United Kingdom Department for Science Innovation Technology realised a report on cyber attacks over the last 12 months They surveyed 2263 UK businesses 1174 UK registered charities and 554 education institutions The research found that 32 of businesses and 24 of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months This figures were much higher for medium businesses 59 large businesses 69 and highincome charities with 500000 or more in annual income 56 Yet although medium or large businesses are more often the victims since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize businesses SMBs have also become increasing vulnerable as they often do not have advanced tools to defend the business SMBs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attacks and Denialof Service DoS AttacksNormal people working for a business or simply using the internet are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyber attacks These are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices services or users as possible They do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the Internet These strategies mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanningTo secure a computer system it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories Backdoor A backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls These weaknesses may exist for many reasons including original design or poor configuration Due to the nature of backdoors they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals Backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons However criminals often use malware to install backdoors giving them remote administrative access to a system Once they have access cybercriminals can modify files steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computerBackdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who has access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer Denialofservice attack Denial of service attacks DoS are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users Attackers can deny service to individual victims such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many forms of Distributed denial of service DDoS attacks are possible where the attack comes from a large number of points and defending is much more difficult Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques including distributed reflective denial of service DRDoS where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim With such attacks the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks see the attacker motivation section Directaccess attacks A directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gains physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or to steal information Attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications installing software worms keyloggers covert listening devices or using wireless microphones Even when the system is protected by standard security measures these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CDROM or other bootable media Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks Direct service attackers are related in concept to direct memory attacks that allows an attacker to gain direct access to a computers memory The attacks take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allow certain devices such as external hard drives graphics cards or network cards to access the computers memory directlyTo help prevent these attacks computer users must ensure that they have a strong passwords that their computer is locked at all times when they are not using it and that they keep their computer with them at all times when traveling Eavesdropping Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between hosts on a network It typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited Data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods Unlike malware directaccess attacks or other forms of cyber attacks eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices making them difficult to notice In fact the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all He or she can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined timeUsing a virtual private network VPN which encrypts data between two points is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping Using the best form of encryption possible for wireless networks is best practice as well as using HTTPS instead of unencrypted HTTPPrograms such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers Even machines that operate as a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks Malware Malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users Once present on a computer it can leak sensitive details such as personal information business information and passwords can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently Another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victims machine encrypts their files and then turns around and demands a ransom usually in Bitcoin to return that data to the userTypes of malware include some of the following Viruses are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijacks software with the intension to do damage and spread copies of itself Copies are made with the aim to spread to other programs on a computer Worms are similar to viruses however viruses can only function when a user runs opens a comprised program Worms therefore are selfreplicating malware that spread between programs apps and devices without the need for human interaction Trojan horses are programs that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick users into installing them Once installed a RAT remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device Spyware is a type of malware that secretly gathers information on an infected computers and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker One of the most common forms of spyware are known as keyloggers which is a kind of malware which recorders all of a users keyboard inputskeystrokes used to allow hackers to harvest usernames passwords bank account and credit card numbers Scareware as the name suggests is a form of malware which uses social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying or installing unwanted software These attacks often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device has a virus Multivector polymorphic attacks Surfacing in 2017 a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threats combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread Multivector polymorphic attacks as the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic Firstly they are a singular offensive that involves multiple methods of attack In this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the Web email and applications However they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network The attacks can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses worms or trojans constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defences Phishing Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames passwords and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one The fake website often asks for personal information such as login details and passwords This information can then be used to gain access to the individuals real account on the real website Preying on a victims trust phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts A common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices to individuals showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized A more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverages personal or organizationspecific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source Spearphishing attacks target specific individuals rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts Privilege escalation Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privileges or access level For example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system The severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amounts of data Privilege escalation usually starts with social engineering techniques often phishingPrivilege escalation can be separated into to strategies horizontal and vertical privilege escalation Horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gains access to a normal user account that has relatively lowlevel privileges This may be through stealing the users username and password Once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of users at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege Vertical escalation however targets people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such as an employee in IT with a higher privilege Using this privileged account will then enable to attacker to invade other accounts Sidechannel attack Any computational system affects its environment in some form This effect it has on its environment includes a wide range of criteria which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequence make a Cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation faults that allow for access and or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible In Sidechannel attack scenarios the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure Social engineering Social engineering in the context of computer security aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords card numbers etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer This generally involves exploiting peoples trust and relying on their cognitive biases A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action One of the main techniques of social engineering are phishing attacks In early 2016 the FBI reported that such business email compromise BEC scams had cost US businesses more than 2 billion in about two yearsIn May 2016 the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the teams president Peter Feigin resulting in the handover of all the teams employees 2015 W2 tax forms Spoofing Spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such as an IP address or username in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain Spoofing is closely related to phishing There are several types of spoofing including Email spoofing is where an attacker forges the sending From or source address of an email IP address spoofing where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system MAC spoofing where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control MAC address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose as another Biometric spoofing where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user Address Resolution Protocol ARP spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their Media Access Control address with a different hosts IP address This causes data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended hostIn 2018 the cybersecurity firm Trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry Tampering Tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data An intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system components of systems its intended behavior or data Socalled Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples HTML smuggling HTML smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular HTML or web page HTML files can carry payloads concealed as benign inert data in order to defeat content filters These payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filterWhen a target user opens the HTML the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the targets device Information security culture Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization Information security culture is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kindsAndersson and Reimers 2014 found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organizations information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes Indeed the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2020 which examined 3950 security breaches discovered 30 of cybersecurity incidents involved internal actors within a company Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change authors commented Its a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance To manage the information security culture five steps should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation Preevaluation To identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies Strategic planning To come up with a better awareness program clear targets need to be set Assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it Operative planning A good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program Implementation Four stages should be used to implement the information security culture They areCommitment of the management Communication with organizational members Courses for all organizational members Commitment of the employeesPostevaluation To assess the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved areas of concern Computer protection countermeasures In computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be takenSome common countermeasures are listed in the following sections Security by design Security by design or alternately secure by design means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure In this case security is considered a main feature The UK governments National Cyber Security Centre separate secure cyber design principles into five sections Before a secure system is created or updated companies should ensure they understand the fundamentals and the context around the system they are trying to create and to identify any apart weaknesses in a system Companies should design and centre their security around techniques and defences which make attacking their data or systems inherently more challenging for attackers Companies should ensure that their core services that rely on technology are protected so that the technology is always available Although systems can be created which are safe against a multitude of attacks that does not mean that attacks will not be attempted Despite ones security all companies systems should aim to be able to detect and spot attacks as soon as they occur to ensure the most effective response to them Companies should create secure systems designed so that any attack that is successful has a loss severityThese design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques The principle of least privilege where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function That way even if an attacker gains access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system Automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems Code reviews and unit testing approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible Defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds Default secure settings and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering Ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure Audit trails track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined Storing audit trails remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruders from covering their tracks Full disclosure of all vulnerabilities to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered Security architecture Security architecture can be defined as the practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals These goals have overlap with the principles of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise In practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new changes are safe and meet the security requirements of the organisationSimilarly Techopedia defines security architecture as a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment It also specifies when and where to apply security controls The design process is generally reproducible The key attributes of security architecture are the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other determination of controls based on risk assessment good practices finances and legal matters the standardization of controlsPracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business IT and security concerns in an organization Security measures A state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of the three processes threat prevention detection and response These processes are based on various policies and system components which include the following Limiting the access of individuals using user account access controls and using cryptography can protect systems files and data respectively Firewalls are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can if properly configured shield access to internal network services and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering Firewalls can be both hardware and softwarebased Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network Intrusion Detection System IDS products are designed to detect network attacks inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trails and logs serve a similar function for individual systems Response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of legal authorities counterattacks and the like In some special cases the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected Cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threats and attacks Forward web proxy solutions can prevent the client to visit malicious web pages and inspect the content before downloading to the client machinesToday computer security consists mainly of preventive measures like firewalls or an exit procedure A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such as the Internet They can be implemented as software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most UNIXbased operating systems such as Linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking Another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the Internet Some organizations are turning to big data platforms such as Apache Hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threatsIn order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known as the CIA triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security To achieve those objectives administrative physical and technical security measures should be employed The amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known Vulnerability management Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities especially in software and firmware Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities such as open ports insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware In order for these tools to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release Typically these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently Beyond vulnerability scanning many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular penetration tests against their systems to identify vulnerabilities In some sectors this is a contractual requirement Reducing vulnerabilities The act of assessing and reducing vulnerabilities to cyber attacks is commonly referred to as information technology security assessments They aims to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities While formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible it is not yet common Operating systems formally verified include seL4 and SYSGOs PikeOS but these make up a very small percentage of the market It is possible to reduce an attackers chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates andor hiring people with expertise in security Large companies with significant threats can hire Security Operations Centre SOC Analysts These are specialists in cyber defences with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating reports of any new issues and preparing and testing disaster recovery plansWhilst no measures can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measures can help mitigate the damage of possible attacks The effects of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance Outside of formal assessments there are various methods of reducing vulnerabilities Two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information It requires something you know a password or PIN and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access Protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attacks can only be occur by noncomputer means which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving peoples knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing peoples awareness of threats However even in highly disciplined environments eg military organizations social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent Inoculation derived from inoculation theory seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts Hardware protection mechanisms Hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to softwareonly computer security Using devices and methods such as dongles trusted platform modules intrusionaware cases drive locks disabling USB ports and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised Each of these is covered in more detail below USB dongles are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other devices software The dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such as Advanced Encryption Standard AES provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing webbased content such as cloud software or Virtual Private Networks VPNs In addition a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer Trusted platform modules TPMs secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices through the use of microprocessors or socalled computersonachip TPMs used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices preventing unauthorized network and data access Computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives making them inaccessible to thieves Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices like camera GPS removable storage etc that are not in use Mobileenabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones Builtin capabilities such as Bluetooth the newer Bluetooth low energy LE nearfield communication NFC on noniOS devices and biometric validation such as thumbprint readers as well as QR code reader software designed for mobile devices offer new secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings IOMMUs allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of components in mobile and desktop computers by utilizing direct memory access protections Physical Unclonable Functions PUFs can be used as a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuits and hardware providing users the ability to secure the hardware supply chains going into their systems Secure operating systems One use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems Using secure operating systems is a good way of ensuring computer security These are systems that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluations are Common Criteria CC Secure coding In software engineering secure coding aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure Such systems are secure by design Beyond this formal verification aims to prove the correctness of the algorithms underlying a system important for cryptographic protocols for example Capabilities and access control lists Within computer systems two of the main security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists ACLs and rolebased access control RBAC An accesscontrol list ACL with respect to a computer file system is a list of permissions associated with an object An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects as well as what operations are allowed on given objects Rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees and can implement mandatory access control MAC or discretionary access control DAC A further approach capabilitybased security has been mostly restricted to research operating systems Capabilities can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design An opensource project in the area is the E language User security training The enduser is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than 90 of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management sending emails containing sensitive data and attachments to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments A common mistake that users make is saving their user idpassword in their browsers to make it easier to log in to banking sites This is a gift to attackers who have obtained access to a machine by some means The risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authenticationAs the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all levels not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats The focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks Digital hygiene Related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and as the analogy with personal hygiene shows is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimize the risks from cyber threats The assumption is that good cyber hygiene practices can give networked users another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attacks or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks Cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military termThe most common acts of digitalcyber hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backups passwords and ensuring restricted admin rights and network firewalls As opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threats cyber hygiene mostly regards routine measures that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education It can be thought of as an abstract list of tips or measures that have been demonstrated as having a positive effect on personal andor collective digital security As such these measures can be performed by laypeople not just security experts Cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene as computer viruses relate to biological viruses or pathogens However while the term computer virus was coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer viruses the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps as late as 2000 by Internet pioneer Vint Cerf It has since been adopted by the Congress and Senate of the United States the FBI EU institutions and heads of state Difficulty of responding to breaches Responding to attempted security breaches is often very difficult for a variety of reasons including Identifying attackers is difficult as they may operate through proxies temporary anonymous dialup accounts wireless connections and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction If they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete logs to cover their tracks The sheer number of attempted attacks often by automated vulnerability scanners and computer worms is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each Law enforcement officers often lack the skills interest or budget to pursue attackers In addition the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries which may be difficult or timeconsuming to obtainWhere an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdictions now have in place mandatory security breach notification laws Types of security and privacy Systems at risk The growth in the number of computer systems and the increasing reliance upon them by individuals businesses industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk Financial systems The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the US Securities and Exchange Commission SWIFT investment banks and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers brokerage accounts and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchases or selling the information on the black market Instore payment systems and ATMs have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and PINs The UCLA Internet Report Surveying the Digital Future 2000 found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users were somewhat or very concerned about credit card securityThe most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named SSL Secure Sockets Layer and its successor TLS Transport Layer Security identity management and authentication services and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce Several versions of SSL and TLS are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and VoIP voiceoverIP There are various interoperable implementations of these technologies including at least one implementation that is open source Open source allows anyone to view the applications source code and look for and report vulnerabilities The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard cooperated to develop the secure EMV chip which is embedded in credit cards Further developments include the Chip Authentication Program where banks give customers handheld card readers to perform online secure transactions Other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as Instant Issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue onthespot credit cards to interested customers Utilities and industrial equipment Computers control functions at many utilities including coordination of telecommunications the power grid nuclear power plants and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable In 2014 the Computer Emergency Readiness Team a division of the Department of Homeland Security investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies Aviation The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore There is also potential for attack from within an aircraftIn Europe with the PanEuropean Network Service and NewPENS and in the US with the NextGen program air navigation service providers are moving to create their own dedicated networks Many modern passports are now biometric passports containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name gender and date of birth In addition more countries are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud The introduction of the ePassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing Plans are under way in the US the UK and Australia to introduce SmartGate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology The airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets etickets These have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines Longdistance bus companies are also switching over to eticketing transactions today The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outages loss of aircraft and even loss of life Consumer devices Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target Smartphones tablet computers smart watches and other mobile devices such as quantified self devices like activity trackers have sensors such as cameras microphones GPS receivers compasses and accelerometers which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information WiFi Bluetooth and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breachThe increasing number of home automation devices such as the Nest thermostat are also potential targets Healthcare Today many healthcare providers and health insurance companies use the internet to provide enhanced products and services for example through use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness trackers to lower insurance premiums The health care company Humana partners with WebMD Oracle Corporation EDS and Microsoft to enable its members to access their health care records as well as to provide an overview of health care plans Patient records are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse networks alleviating the need for extra storage space Large corporations Large corporations are common targets In many cases attacks are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breaches Examples include the loss of millions of clients credit card and financial details by Home Depot Staples Target Corporation and EquifaxMedical records have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patients to obtain prescription drugs for recreational purposes or resale Although cyber threats continue to increase 62 of all organizations did not increase security training for their business in 2015Not all attacks are financially motivated however security firm HBGary Federal had a serious series of attacks in 2011 from hacktivist group Anonymous in retaliation for the firms CEO claiming to have infiltrated their group and Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014 with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leaks and crippling the company by wiping workstations and servers Automobiles Vehicles are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brakes seat belt tensioners door locks airbags and advanced driverassistance systems on many models Additionally connected cars may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network Selfdriving cars are expected to be even more complex All of these systems carry some security risks and such issues have gained wide attentionSimple examples of risk include a malicious compact disc being used as an attack vector and the cars onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping However if access is gained to a cars internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized 2015 test hackers remotely carjacked a vehicle from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditchManufacturers are reacting in numerous ways with Tesla in 2016 pushing out some security fixes over the air into its cars computer systems In the area of autonomous vehicles in September 2016 the United States Department of Transportation announced some initial safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policiesAdditionally eDrivers licenses are being developed using the same technology For example Mexicos licensing authority ICV has used a smart card platform to issue the first eDrivers licenses to the city of Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Len Shipping Shipping companies have adopted RFID Radio Frequency Identification technology as an efficient digitally secure tracking device Unlike a barcode RFID can be read up to 20 feet away RFID is used by FedEx and UPS Government Government and military computer systems are commonly attacked by activists and foreign powers Local and regional government infrastructure such as traffic light controls police and intelligence agency communications personnel records as well as student recordsThe FBI CIA and Pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their buildings However the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world More and more companies are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology GEs ACUVision for example offers a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording Internet of things and physical vulnerabilities The Internet of things IoT is the network of physical objects such as devices vehicles and buildings that are embedded with electronics software sensors and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data Concerns have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenges involvedWhile the IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems it also provides opportunities for misuse In particular as the Internet of Things spreads widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat If a front doors lock is connected to the Internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone People could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by IoTenabled devices Thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent nonInternetconnected hotel door locksAn attack that targets physical infrastructure andor human lives is sometimes referred to as a cyberkinetic attack As IoT devices and appliances gain currency cyberkinetic attacks can become pervasive and significantly damaging Medical systems Medical devices have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerabilities demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted devices including pacemakers and insulin pumps There are many reports of hospitals and hospital organizations getting hacked including ransomware attacks Windows XP exploits viruses and data breaches of sensitive data stored on hospital servers On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internetconnected devices but no structure for enforcement Energy sector In distributed generation systems the risk of a cyber attack is real according to Daily Energy Insider An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources DER Authority within the city with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility Pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand The DC proposal however would allow thirdparty vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid Telecommunications Perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the SIM Subscriber Identity Module card a device that is embedded in most of the worlds cellular devices before any service can be obtained The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment The Smart Card Web Servers draft standard SCWS defines the interfaces to an HTTP server in a smart card Tests are being conducted to secure OTA overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone Combination SIMDVD devices are being developed through Smart Video Card technology which embeds a DVDcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular SIM card Other telecommunication developments involving digital security include mobile signatures which use the embedded SIM card to generate a legally binding electronic signature Cost and impact of security breaches Serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from 13 billion worms and viruses only to 226 billion for all forms of covert attacks The reliability of these estimates is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotalHowever reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions According to the classic GordonLoeb Model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach Attacker motivation As with physical security the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers Some are thrillseekers or vandals some are activists others are criminals looking for financial gain Statesponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as Markus Hess who hacked for the KGB as recounted by Clifford Stoll in The Cuckoos Egg Attackers motivations can vary for all types of attacks from pleasure to for political goals For example hacktivists may target a company a company or organisation that carries out activities they do not agree with This would be to create bad publicity for the company by having its website crash High capability hackers often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demands of their financial backers These attacks are more likely to attempt more serious attack An example of a more serious attack was the 2015 Ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of files and denialofservice attacks to carry out the full attackAdditionally recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas The growth of the internet mobile technologies and inexpensive computing devices have led to a rise in capabilities but also to the risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations All critical targeted environments are susceptible to compromise and this has led to a series of proactive studies on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivations by these types of actors Several stark differences exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actors seeking to attack based on an ideological preferenceA standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system and who might be motivated to breach it The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured A home personal computer bank and classified military network face very different threats even when the underlying technologies in use are similar Computer security incident management Computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business as usual Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities restore services and processes and minimize losses Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organizations response to a cyberattack Without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles processes and procedures during an escalation slowing the organizations response and resolution There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan Preparation Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises Detection and analysis Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident Containment eradication and recovery Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains Post incident activity Post mortem analysis of the incident its root cause and the organizations response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts Notable attacks and breaches Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below Robert Morris and the first computer worm In 1988 60000 computers were connected to the Internet and most were mainframes minicomputers and professional workstations On 2 November 1988 many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers the first internet computer worm The software was traced back to 23yearold Cornell University graduate student Robert Tappan Morris who said he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet Rome Laboratory In 1994 over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory the US Air Forces main command and research facility Using trojan horses hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Romes networking systems and remove traces of their activities The intruders were able to obtain classified files such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Goddard Space Flight Center WrightPatterson Air Force Base some Defense contractors and other private sector organizations by posing as a trusted Rome center user TJX customer credit card details In early 2007 American apparel and home goods company TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion and that the hackers had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transactions Stuxnet attack In 2010 the computer worm known as Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of Irans nuclear centrifuges It did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controllers PLCs in a targeted attack This is generally believed to have been launched by Israel and the United States to disrupt Irans nuclear program although neither has publicly admitted this Global surveillance disclosures In early 2013 documents provided by Edward Snowden were published by The Washington Post and The Guardian exposing the massive scale of NSA global surveillance There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a NIST standard for encryption This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between Googles data centers Target and Home Depot breaches A Ukrainian hacker known as Rescator broke into Target Corporation computers in 2013 stealing roughly 40 million credit cards and then Home Depot computers in 2014 stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers Warnings were delivered at both corporations but ignored physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting says Jim Walter director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing Office of Personnel Management data breach In April 2015 the Office of Personnel Management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately 215 million personnel records handled by the office The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States Data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers names dates and places of birth addresses and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers Ashley Madison breach In July 2015 a hacker group is known as The Impact Team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison created by Avid Life Media The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well After the breach The Impact Team dumped emails from the companys CEO to prove their point and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently When Avid Life Media did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed files one 97GB and the second 20GB After the second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned but the website remained to function Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack In June 2021 the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the US and led to shortages across the East Coast Legal issues and global regulation International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature There is no global base of common rules to judge and eventually punish cybercrimes and cybercriminals and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute Proving attribution for cybercrimes and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies Computer viruses switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operations like this So the Internet is as if someone had given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world The use of techniques such as dynamic DNS fast flux and bullet proof servers add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement Role of government The role of the government is to make regulations to force companies and organizations to protect their systems infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national powergridThe governments regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated For some cyberspace was seen as a virtual space that was to remain free of government intervention as can be seen in many of todays libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussionsMany government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem R Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco he believes that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation If the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through On the other hand executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently Daniel R McCarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political orderOn 22 May 2020 the UN Security Council held its second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenges to international peace According to UN SecretaryGeneral Antnio Guterres new technologies are too often used to violate rights International actions Many different teams and organizations exist including The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams FIRST is the global association of CSIRTs The USCERT ATT Apple Cisco McAfee Microsoft are all members of this international team The Council of Europe helps protect societies worldwide from the threat of cybercrime through the Convention on Cybercrime The purpose of the Messaging AntiAbuse Working Group MAAWG is to bring the messaging industry together to work collaboratively and to successfully address the various forms of messaging abuse such as spam viruses denialofservice attacks and other messaging exploitations France Telecom Facebook ATT Apple Cisco Sprint are some of the members of the MAAWG ENISA The European Network and Information Security Agency ENISA is an agency of the European Union with the objective to improve network and information security in the European Union Europe On 14 April 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR The GDPR which came into force on 25 May 2018 grants individuals within the European Union EU and the European Economic Area EEA the right to the protection of personal data The regulation requires that any entity that processes personal data incorporate data protection by design and by default It also requires that certain organizations appoint a Data Protection Officer DPO National actions Computer emergency response teams Most countries have their own computer emergency response team to protect network security Canada Since 2010 Canada has had a cybersecurity strategy This functions as a counterpart document to the National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure The strategy has three main pillars securing government systems securing vital private cyber systems and helping Canadians to be secure online There is also a Cyber Incident Management Framework to provide a coordinated response in the event of a cyber incidentThe Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre CCIRC is responsible for mitigating and responding to threats to Canadas critical infrastructure and cyber systems It provides support to mitigate cyber threats technical support to respond recover from targeted cyber attacks and provides online tools for members of Canadas critical infrastructure sectors It posts regular cybersecurity bulletins operates an online reporting tool where individuals and organizations can report a cyber incidentTo inform the general public on how to protect themselves online Public Safety Canada has partnered with STOPTHINKCONNECT a coalition of nonprofit private sector and government organizations and launched the Cyber Security Cooperation Program They also run the GetCyberSafe portal for Canadian citizens and Cyber Security Awareness Month during OctoberPublic Safety Canada aims to begin an evaluation of Canadas cybersecurity strategy in early 2015 Australia Australian federal government announced an 182 million investment to fortify the cybersecurity resilience of small and medium enterprises SMEs and enhance their capabilities in responding to cyber threats This financial backing is an integral component of the soontobeunveiled 20232030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy slated for release within the current week A substantial allocation of 72 million is earmarked for the establishment of a voluntary cyber health check program facilitating businesses in conducting a comprehensive and tailored selfassessment of their cybersecurity upskill This avantgarde health assessment serves as a diagnostic tool enabling enterprises to ascertain the robustness of Australias cyber security regulations Furthermore it affords them access to a repository of educational resources and materials fostering the acquisition of skills necessary for an elevated cybersecurity posture This groundbreaking initiative was jointly disclosed by Minister for Cyber Security Clare ONeil and Minister for Small Business Julie Collins America The United States has its first fully formed cyber plan in 15 years as a result of the release of this National Cyber plan In this policy the US says it will Protect the country by keeping networks systems functions and data safe Promote American wealth by building a strong digital economy and encouraging strong domestic innovation Peace and safety should be kept by making it easier for the US to stop people from using computer tools for bad things working with friends and partners to do this and Increase the United States impact around the world to support the main ideas behind an open safe reliable and compatible Internet The new US cyber strategy seeks to allay some of those concerns by promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace urging nations to adhere to a set of norms both through international law and voluntary standards It also calls for specific measures to harden US government networks from attacks like the June 2015 intrusion into the US Office of Personnel Management OPM which compromised the records of about 42 million current and former government employees And the strategy calls for the US to continue to name and shame bad cyber actors calling them out publicly for attacks when possible along with the use of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure India Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy framework by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology MeitY which aims to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyberattacks and safeguard information such as personal information of web users financial and banking information and sovereign data CERT In is the nodal agency which monitors the cyber threats in the country The post of National Cyber Security Coordinator has also been created in the Prime Ministers Office PMO The Indian Companies Act 2013 has also introduced cyber law and cybersecurity obligations on the part of Indian directors Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000 Update in 2013 South Korea Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013 when the government news media television stations and bank websites were compromised the national government committed to the training of 5000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017 The South Korean government blamed its northern counterpart for these attacks as well as incidents that occurred in 2009 2011 and 2012 but Pyongyang denies the accusations United States Legislation The 1986 18 USC 1030 the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the key legislation It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of protected computers as defined in 18 USC 1030e2 Although various other measures have been proposed none has succeeded In 2013 executive order 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was signed which prompted the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework In response to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14028 on May 12 2021 to increase software security standards for sales to the government tighten detection and security on existing systems improve information sharing and training establish a Cyber Safety Review Board and improve incident response Standardized government testing services The General Services Administration GSA has standardized the penetration test service as a prevetted support service to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities and stop adversaries before they impact US federal state and local governments These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services HACS Agencies The Department of Homeland Security has a dedicated division responsible for the response system risk management program and requirements for cybersecurity in the United States called the National Cyber Security Division The division is home to USCERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructureThe third priority of the FBI is to Protect the United States against cyberbased attacks and hightechnology crimes and they along with the National White Collar Crime Center NW3C and the Bureau of Justice Assistance BJA are part of the multiagency task force The Internet Crime Complaint Center also known as IC3In addition to its own specific duties the FBI participates alongside nonprofit organizations such as InfraGardThe Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS operates in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division The CCIPS is in charge of investigating computer crime and intellectual property crime and is specialized in the search and seizure of digital evidence in computers and networks In 2017 CCIPS published A Framework for a Vulnerability Disclosure Program for Online Systems to help organizations clearly describe authorized vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct thereby substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal violation of law under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030The United States Cyber Command also known as USCYBERCOM has the mission to direct synchronize and coordinate cyberspace planning and operations to defend and advance national interests in collaboration with domestic and international partners It has no role in the protection of civilian networksThe US Federal Communications Commissions role in cybersecurity is to strengthen the protection of critical communications infrastructure to assist in maintaining the reliability of networks during disasters to aid in swift recovery after and to ensure that first responders have access to effective communications servicesThe Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance for medical devices and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is concerned with automotive cybersecurity After being criticized by the Government Accountability Office and following successful attacks on airports and claimed attacks on airplanes the Federal Aviation Administration has devoted funding to securing systems on board the planes of private manufacturers and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System Concerns have also been raised about the future Next Generation Air Transportation SystemThe US Department of Defense DoD issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004 supplemented by DoD Directive 8140 requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology IT certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge skills and abilities KSA Andersson and Reimers 2019 report these certifications range from CompTIAs A and Security through the ICS2orgs CISSP etc Computer emergency readiness team Computer emergency response team is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents In the US two distinct organizations exist although they do work closely together USCERT part of the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security CERTCC created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and run by the Software Engineering Institute SEI US NRC 10 CFR 7354 Cybersecurity In the context of US nuclear power plants the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC outlines cybersecurity requirements under 10 CFR Part 73 specifically in 7354 This section mandates that licensees provide high assurance against cyber attacks for digital equipment and computers and communications systems related to safety security emergency preparedness and support systems Licensees must submit a cybersecurity plan establish a comprehensive cybersecurity program and implement defenseindepth strategies to protect against cyber threats The plan must also include incident response and recovery measures ie Contingency Plans Contingency Plans for Power Grid for cyber attacks Details can be found in 10 CFR 7354 Protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks NEI 0809 Cybersecurity Plan for Nuclear Power Plants The Nuclear Energy Institutes NEI 0809 document Security Plan for Nuclear Power Reactors outlines a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity in the nuclear power industry Drafted with input from the US NRC this guideline is instrumental in aiding licensees to comply with Title 10 Part 73 Section 7354 10 CFR 7354 of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR which mandates robust protection of digital computers and equipment and communications systems at nuclear power plants against cyber threats NEI 0809 provides a structured approach to cybersecurity encompassing aspects such as the creation of a cyber security plan implementation of technical and management security controls and integration of these plans into the overall physical protection programs eg Physical Security Programs and other general Nuclear Security Programs in place at nuclear facilities It emphasizes a defenseindepth strategy employing layered security measures to safeguard critical digital assets CDAs ie critical assets businesscritical assets safetycritical assets from cyber attacks thereby ensuring the safety and integrity of nuclear power operations Refer to NEI 0809 for more details Modern warfare There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare As Mark Clayton from The Christian Science Monitor wrote in a 2015 article titled The New Cyber Arms Race In the future wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities transportation communications and energy Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops the path of jet fighters the command and control of warships This has led to new terms such as cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism The United States Cyber Command was created in 2009 and many other countries have similar forces There are a few critical voices that question whether cybersecurity is as significant a threat as it is made out to be Careers Cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of IT concerned with reducing organizations risk of hack or data breaches According to research from the Enterprise Strategy Group 46 of organizations say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skills in 2016 up from 28 in 2015 Commercial government and nongovernmental organizations all employ cybersecurity professionals The fastest increases in demand for cybersecurity workers are in industries managing increasing volumes of consumer data such as finance health care and retail However the use of the term cybersecurity is more prevalent in government job descriptionsTypical cybersecurity job

option for information security professionals of all experience levels to keep studying is online security training including webcasts A wide range of certified courses are also availableIn the United Kingdom a nationwide set of cybersecurity forums known as the UK Cyber Security Forum were established supported by the Governments cybersecurity strategy in order to encourage startups and innovation and to address the skills gap identified by the UK Government In Singapore the Cyber Security Agency has issued a Singapore Operational Technology OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework OTCCF The framework defines emerging cybersecurity roles in Operational Technology The OTCCF was endorsed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority IMDA It outlines the different OT cybersecurity job positions as well as the technical skills and core competencies necessary It also depicts the many career paths available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunities Terminology The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below Access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems These systems can protect either the whole computer such as through an interactive login screen or individual services such as a FTP server There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users such as passwords identification cards smart cards and biometric systems Antivirus software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software malware Applications are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block users the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignments to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing as few as possible They are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patches or updates for them For example programs can be installed into an individual users account which limits the programs potential access as well as being a means control which users have specific exceptions to policy In Linux FreeBSD OpenBSD and other Unixlike operating systems there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other means of restricting the application to its own sandbox For example Linux provides namespaces and Cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resources Generalized security frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor help administrators control access Java and other languages which compile to Java byte code and run in the Java virtual machine can have their access to other applications controlled at the virtual machine level Some software can be run in software containers which can even provide their own set of system libraries limiting the softwares or anyone controlling it access to the servers versions of the libraries Authentication techniques can be used to ensure that communication endpoints are who they say they are Automated theorem proving and other verification tools can be used to enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications Backups are one or more copies kept of important computer files Typically multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copies will still exist Capability and access control list techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control Capabilities vs ACLs discusses their use Chain of trust techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the systems designers Confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person Cryptographic techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems reducing the probability that the data exchange between systems can be intercepted or modified Cyberwarfare is an Internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems Such attacks can for example disable official websites and networks disrupt or disable essential services steal or alter classified data and cripple financial systems Data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data recordEncryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible Symmetrickey ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys and publickey encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance Endpoint security software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops mobile devices and USB drives Firewalls serve as a gatekeeper system between networks allowing only traffic that matches defined rules They often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features They are nearuniversal between company local area networks and the Internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured A hacker is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network Honey pots are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques Intrusiondetection systems are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations A microkernel is an approach to operating system design which has only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers protocol stacks and file systems in the safer less privileged user space Pinging The standard ping application can be used to test if an IP address is in use If it is attackers may then try a port scan to detect which services are exposed A port scan is used to probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications A key logger is spyware that silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user types on the computers keyboard Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security Logic bombs is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific event Zero trust security means that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resources on the network History Since the Internets arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years the notion of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives Cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 60 years of technological change In the 1970s and 1980s computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of the Internet where with increased connectivity computer viruses and network intrusions began to take off After the spread of viruses in the 1990s the 2000s marked the institutionalization of organized attacks such as distributed denial of service This led to the formalization of cybersecurity as a professional disciplineThe April 1967 session organized by Willis Ware at the Spring Joint Computer Conference and the later publication of the Ware Report were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security Wares work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concernsA 1977 NIST publication introduced the CIA triad of confidentiality integrity and availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals While still relevant many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposedHowever in the 1970s and 1980s there were no grave computer threats because computers and the internet were still developing and security threats were easily identifiable More often threats came from malicious insiders who gained unauthorized access to sensitive documents and files Although malware and network breaches existed during the early years they did not use them for financial gain By the second half of the 1970s established computer firms like IBM started offering commercial access control systems and computer security software productsOne of the earliest examples of an attack on a computer network was the computer worm Creeper written by Bob Thomas at BBN which propagated through the ARPANET in 1971 The program was purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload A later program Reaper was created by Ray Tomlinson in 1972 and used to destroy CreeperBetween September 1986 and June 1987 a group of German hackers performed the first documented case of cyber espionage The group hacked into American defense contractors universities and military base networks and sold gathered information to the Soviet KGB The group was led by Markus Hess who was arrested on 29 June 1987 He was convicted of espionage along with two coconspirators on 15 Feb 1990 In 1988 one of the first computer worms called the Morris worm was distributed via the Internet It gained significant mainstream media attentionIn 1993 Netscape started developing the protocol SSL shortly after the National Center for Supercomputing Applications NCSA launched Mosaic 10 the first web browser in 1993 Netscape had SSL version 10 ready in 1994 but it was never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerabilities These weaknesses included replay attacks and a vulnerability that allowed hackers to alter unencrypted communications sent by users However in February 1995 Netscape launched Version 20The National Security Agency NSA is responsible for the protection of US information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence The agency analyzes commonly used software and system configurations to find security flaws which it can use for offensive purposes against competitors of the United StatesNSA contractors created and sold clickandshoot attack tools to US agencies and close allies but eventually the tools made their way to foreign adversaries In 2016 NSAs own hacking tools were hacked and they have been used by Russia and North Korea NSAs employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries anxious to compete in cyberwarfare In 2007 the United States and Israel began exploiting security flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in Iran to refine nuclear materials Iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability which it began using against the United States Notable scholars See also References Further reading Branch Jordan 24 September 2020 Whats in a Name Metaphors and Cybersecurity International Organization Cambridge University Press CUP

Authentication,Authentication from Greek authentikos real genuine from authentes author is the act of proving an assertion such as the identity of a computer system user In contrast with identification the act of indicating a person or things identity authentication is the process of verifying that identity It might involve validating personal identity documents verifying the authenticity of a website with a digital certificate determining the age of an artifact by carbon dating or ensuring that a product or document is not counterfeit Methods Authentication is relevant to multiple fields In art antiques and anthropology a common problem is verifying that a given artifact was produced by a certain person or in a certain place or period of history In computer science verifying a users identity is often required to allow access to confidential data or systemsAuthentication can be considered to be of three types The first type of authentication is accepting proof of identity given by a credible person who has firsthand evidence that the identity is genuine When authentication is required of art or physical objects this proof could be a friend family member or colleague attesting to the items provenance perhaps by having witnessed the item in its creators possession With autographed sports memorabilia this could involve someone attesting that they witnessed the object being signed A vendor selling branded items implies authenticity while they may not have evidence that every step in the supply chain was authenticated Centralized authoritybased trust relationships back most secure internet communication through known public certificate authorities decentralized peerbased trust also known as a web of trust is used for personal services such as email or files and trust is established by known individuals signing each others cryptographic key for instance The second type of authentication is comparing the attributes of the object itself to what is known about objects of that origin For example an art expert might look for similarities in the style of painting check the location and form of a signature or compare the object to an old photograph An archaeologist on the other hand might use carbon dating to verify the age of an artifact do a chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the materials used or compare the style of construction or decoration to other artifacts of similar origin The physics of sound and light and comparison with a known physical environment can be used to examine the authenticity of audio recordings photographs or videos Documents can be verified as being created on ink or paper readily available at the time of the items implied creation Attribute comparison may be vulnerable to forgery In general it relies on the facts that creating a forgery indistinguishable from a genuine artifact requires expert knowledge that mistakes are easily made and that the amount of effort required to do so is considerably greater than the amount of profit that can be gained from the forgery In art and antiques certificates are of great importance for authenticating an object of interest and value Certificates can however also be forged and the authentication of these poses a problem For instance the son of Han van Meegeren the wellknown artforger forged the work of his father and provided a certificate for its provenance as well Criminal and civil penalties for fraud forgery and counterfeiting can reduce the incentive for falsification depending on the risk of getting caught Currency and other financial instruments commonly use this second type of authentication method Bills coins and cheques incorporate hardtoduplicate physical features such as fine printing or engraving distinctive feel watermarks and holographic imagery which are easy for trained receivers to verify The third type of authentication relies on documentation or other external affirmations In criminal courts the rules of evidence often require establishing the chain of custody of evidence presented This can be accomplished through a written evidence log or by testimony from the police detectives and forensics staff that handled it Some antiques are accompanied by certificates attesting to their authenticity Signed sports memorabilia is usually accompanied by a certificate of authenticity These external records have their own problems of forgery and perjury and are also vulnerable to being separated from the artifact and lost In computer science a user can be given access to secure systems based on user credentials that imply authenticity A network administrator can give a user a password or provide the user with a key card or other access devices to allow system access In this case authenticity is implied but not guaranteed Consumer goods such as pharmaceuticals perfume and clothing can use all forms of authentication to prevent counterfeit goods from taking advantage of a popular brands reputation As mentioned above having an item for sale in a reputable store implicitly attests to it being genuine the first type of authentication The second type of authentication might involve comparing the quality and craftsmanship of an item such as an expensive handbag to genuine articles The third type of authentication could be the presence of a trademark on the item which is a legally protected marking or any other identifying feature which aids consumers in the identification of genuine brandname goods With software companies have taken great steps to protect from counterfeiters including adding holograms security rings security threads and color shifting ink Authentication factors The ways in which someone may be authenticated fall into three categories based on what is known as the factors of authentication something the user knows something the user has and something the user is Each authentication factor covers a range of elements used to authenticate or verify a persons identity before being granted access approving a transaction request signing a document or other work product granting authority to others and establishing a chain of authority Security research has determined that for a positive authentication elements from at least two and preferably all three factors should be verified The three factors classes and some of the elements of each factor are Knowledge Something the user knows eg a password partial password passphrase personal identification number PIN challengeresponse the user must answer a question or pattern security question Ownership Something the user has eg wrist band ID card security token implanted device cell phone with a builtin hardware token software token or cell phone holding a software token Inherence Something the user is or does eg fingerprint retinal pattern DNA sequence there are assorted definitions of what is sufficient signature face voice unique bioelectric signals or other biometric identifiers Singlefactor authentication As the weakest level of authentication only a single component from one of the three categories of factors is used to authenticate an individuals identity The use of only one factor does not offer much protection from misuse or malicious intrusion This type of authentication is not recommended for financial or personally relevant transactions that warrant a higher level of security Multifactor authentication Multifactor authentication involves two or more authentication factors something you know something you have or something you are Twofactor authentication is a special case of multifactor authentication involving exactly two factorsFor example using a bank card something the user has along with a PIN something the user knows provides twofactor authentication Business networks may require users to provide a password knowledge factor and a pseudorandom number from a security token ownership factor Access to a veryhighsecurity system might require a mantrap screening of height weight facial and fingerprint checks several inherence factor elements plus a PIN and a day code knowledge factor elements but this is still a twofactor authentication Authentication types Strong authentication The United States governments National Information Assurance Glossary defines strong authentication as a layered authentication approach relying on two or more authenticators to establish the identity of an originator or receiver of informationThe European Central Bank ECB has defined strong authentication as a procedure based on two or more of the three authentication factors The factors that are used must be mutually independent and at least one factor must be nonreusable and nonreplicable except in the case of an inherence factor and must also be incapable of being stolen off the Internet In the European as well as in the USAmerican understanding strong authentication is very similar to multifactor authentication or 2FA but exceeding those with more rigorous requirementsThe FIDO Alliance has been striving to establish technical specifications for strong authentication Continuous authentication Conventional computer systems authenticate users only at the initial login session which can be the cause of a critical security flaw To resolve this problem systems need continuous user authentication methods that continuously monitor and authenticate users based on some biometric traits A study used behavioural biometrics based on writing styles as a continuous authentication methodRecent research has shown the possibility of using smartphones sensors and accessories to extract some behavioral attributes such as touch dynamics keystroke dynamics and gait recognition These attributes are known as behavioral biometrics and could be used to verify or identify users implicitly and continuously on smartphones The authentication systems that have been built based on these behavioral biometric traits are known as active or continuous authentication systems Digital authentication The term digital authentication also known as electronic authentication or eauthentication refers to a group of processes where the confidence for user identities is established and presented via electronic methods to an information system The digital authentication process creates technical challenges because of the need to authenticate individuals or entities remotely over a network The American National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST has created a generic model for digital authentication that describes the processes that are used to accomplish secure authentication Enrollment an individual applies to a credential service provider CSP to initiate the enrollment process After successfully proving the applicants identity the CSP allows the applicant to become a subscriber Authentication After becoming a subscriber the user receives an authenticator eg a token and credentials such as a user name He or she is then permitted to perform online transactions within an authenticated session with a relying party where they must provide proof that he or she possesses one or more authenticators Lifecycle maintenance the CSP is charged with the task of maintaining the users credential over the course of its lifetime while the subscriber is responsible for maintaining his or her authenticatorsThe authentication of information can pose special problems with electronic communication such as vulnerability to maninthemiddle attacks whereby a third party taps into the communication stream and poses as each of the two other communicating parties in order to intercept information from each Extra identity factors can be required to authenticate each partys identity Product authentication Counterfeit products are often offered to consumers as being authentic Counterfeit consumer goods such as electronics music apparel and counterfeit medications have been sold as being legitimate Efforts to control the supply chain and educate consumers help ensure that authentic products are sold and used Even security printing on packages labels and nameplates however is subject to counterfeitingIn their anticounterfeiting technology guide the EUIPO Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights categorizes the main anticounterfeiting technologies on the market currently into five main categories electronic marking chemical and physical mechanical and technologies for digital mediaProducts or their packaging can include a variable QR Code A QR Code alone is easy to verify but offers a weak level of authentication as it offers no protection against counterfeits unless scan data is analyzed at the system level to detect anomalies To increase the security level the QR Code can be combined with a digital watermark or copy detection pattern that are robust to copy attempts and can be authenticated with a smartphone A secure key storage device can be used for authentication in consumer electronics network authentication license management supply chain management etc Generally the device to be authenticated needs some sort of wireless or wired digital connection to either a host system or a network Nonetheless the component being authenticated need not be electronic in nature as an authentication chip can be mechanically attached and read through a connector to the host eg an authenticated ink tank for use with a printer For products and services that these secure coprocessors can be applied to they can offer a solution that can be much more difficult to counterfeit than most other options while at the same time being more easily verified Packaging Packaging and labeling can be engineered to help reduce the risks of counterfeit consumer goods or the theft and resale of products Some package constructions are more difficult to copy and some have pilfer indicating seals Counterfeit goods unauthorized sales diversion material substitution and tampering can all be reduced with these anticounterfeiting technologies Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit these too are subject to counterfeiting Packages also can include antitheft devices such as dyepacks RFID tags or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate Anticounterfeiting technologies that can be used with packaging include Taggant fingerprinting uniquely coded microscopic materials that are verified from a database Encrypted microparticles unpredictably placed markings numbers layers and colors not visible to the human eye Holograms graphics printed on seals patches foils or labels and used at the point of sale for visual verification Microprinting secondline authentication often used on currencies Serialized barcodes UV printing marks only visible under UV light Track and trace systems use codes to link products to the database tracking system Water indicators become visible when contacted with water DNA tracking genes embedded onto labels that can be traced Colorshifting ink or film visible marks that switch colors or texture when tilted Tamper evident seals and tapes destructible or graphically verifiable at point of sale 2d barcodes data codes that can be tracked RFID chips NFC chips Information content Literary forgery can involve imitating the style of a famous author If an original manuscript typewritten text or recording is available then the medium itself or its packaging anything from a box to email headers can help prove or disprove the authenticity of the document However text audio and video can be copied into new media possibly leaving only the informational content itself to use in authentication Various systems have been invented to allow authors to provide a means for readers to reliably authenticate that a given message originated from or was relayed by them These involve authentication factors like A difficulttoreproduce physical artifact such as a seal signature watermark special stationery or fingerprint A shared secret such as a passphrase in the content of the message An electronic signature publickey infrastructure is often used to cryptographically guarantee that a message has been signed by the holder of a particular private keyThe opposite problem is the detection of plagiarism where information from a different author is passed off as a persons own work A common technique for proving plagiarism is the discovery of another copy of the same or very similar text which has different attribution In some cases excessively high quality or a style mismatch may raise suspicion of plagiarism Literacy and literature authentication In literacy authentication is a readers process of questioning the veracity of an aspect of literature and then verifying those questions via research The fundamental question for authentication of literature is Does one believe it Related to that an authentication project is therefore a reading and writing activity in which students document the relevant research process It builds students critical literacy The documentation materials for literature go beyond narrative texts and likely include informational texts primary sources and multimedia The process typically involves both internet and handson library research When authenticating historical fiction in particular readers consider the extent that the major historical events as well as the culture portrayed eg the language clothing food gender roles are believable for the period History and stateoftheart Historically fingerprints have been used as the most authoritative method of authentication but court cases in the US and elsewhere have raised fundamental doubts about fingerprint reliability Outside of the legal system as well fingerprints are easily spoofable with British Telecoms top computer security official noting that few fingerprint readers have not already been tricked by one spoof or another Hybrid or twotiered authentication methods offer a compelling the solution such as private keys encrypted by fingerprint inside of a USB device In a computer data context cryptographic methods have been developed which are not spoofable if the originators key has not been compromised That the originator or anyone other than an attacker knows or doesnt know about a compromise is irrelevant However it is not known whether these cryptographically based authentication methods are provably secure since unanticipated mathematical developments may make them vulnerable to attack in the future If that were to occur it may call into question much of the authentication in the past In particular a digitally signed contract may be questioned when a new attack on the cryptography underlying the signature is discovered Authorization The process of authorization is distinct from that of authentication Whereas authentication is the process of verifying that you are who you say you are authorization is the process of verifying that you are permitted to do what you are trying to do While authorization often happens immediately after authentication eg when logging into a computer system this does not mean authorization presupposes authentication an anonymous agent could be authorized to a limited action set Access control One familiar use of authentication and authorization is access control A computer system that is supposed to be used only by those authorized must attempt to detect and exclude the unauthorized Access to it is therefore usually controlled by insisting on an authentication procedure to establish with some degree of confidence the identity of the user granting privileges established for that identity See also Authentication protocol

Authorization,Authorization or authorisation see spelling differences is the function of specifying access rightsprivileges to resources which is related to general information security and computer security and to access control in particular More formally to authorize is to define an access policy For example human resources staff are normally authorized to access employee records and this policy is often formalized as access control rules in a computer system During operation the system uses the access control rules to decide whether access requests from authenticated consumers shall be approved granted or disapproved rejected Resources include individual files or an items data computer programs computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications Examples of consumers are computer users computer software and other hardware on the computer Overview Access control in computer systems and networks rely on access policies The access control process can be divided into the following phases policy definition phase where access is authorized and policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations Most modern multiuser operating systems include rolebased access control RBAC and thereby rely on authorization Access control also uses authentication to verify the identity of consumers When a consumer tries to access a resource the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource Authorization is the responsibility of an authority such as a department manager within the application domain but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of policy definition application eg in the form of an access control list or a capability or a policy administration point eg XACML On the basis of the principle of least privilege consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs Older and single user operating systems often had weak or nonexistent authentication and access control systems Anonymous consumers or guests are consumers that have not been required to authenticate They often have limited authorization On a distributed system it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity Familiar examples of access tokens include keys certificates and tickets they grant access without proving identity Trusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision Partially trusted and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage The access policy in some operating systems by default grant all consumers full access to all resources Others do the opposite insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource Even when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials It is often necessary to change or remove a users authorization this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system Using atomic authorization is an alternative to persystem authorization management where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information Related interpretations Public policy In public policy authorization is a feature of trusted systems used for security or social control Banking In banking an authorization is a hold placed on a customers account when a purchase is made using a debit card or credit card Publishing In publishing sometimes public lectures and other freely available texts are published without the approval of the author These are called unauthorized texts An example is the 2002 The Theory of Everything The Origin and Fate of the Universe which was collected from Stephen Hawkings lectures and published without his permission as per copyright law See also References,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization,Short,275,653
Identity Theft,Identity theft identity piracy or identity infringement occurs when someone uses anothers personal identifying information like their name identifying number or credit card number without their permission to commit fraud or other crimes The term identity theft was coined in 1964 Since that time the definition of identity theft has been legally defined throughout both the UK and the US as the theft of personally identifiable information Identity theft deliberately uses someone elses identity as a method to gain financial advantages or obtain credit and other benefits The person whose identity has been stolen may suffer adverse consequences especially if they are falsely held responsible for the perpetrators actions Personally identifiable information generally includes a persons name date of birth social security number drivers license number bank account or credit card numbers PINs electronic signatures fingerprints passwords or any other information that can be used to access a persons financial resourcesDetermining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained According to a report done for the FTC identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person such as when a major data breach occurs A US Government Accountability Office study determined that most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft The report also warned that the full extent is unknown A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that Most often the causes of identity theft is not known but reported that someone else concluded that the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is around only 2 For example in one of the largest data breaches which affected over four million records it resulted in only about 1800 instances of identity theft according to the company whose systems were breachedAn October 2010 article entitled Cyber Crime Made Easy explained the level to which hackers are using malicious software As Gunter Ollmann Chief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft said Interested in credit card theft Theres an app for that This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online The new program for infecting users computers was called Zeus and the program is so hackerfriendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it Although the hacking program is easy to use that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus or other software like Zeus can do on a computer and the user For example programs like Zeus can steal credit card information important documents and even documents necessary for homeland security If a hacker were to gain this information it would mean identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack The ITAC says that about 15 million Americans had their identity stolen in 2012 Types Sources such as the Nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center subdivide identity theft into five categories Criminal identity theft posing as another person when apprehended for a crime Financial identity theft using anothers identity to obtain credit goods and services Identity cloning using anothers information to assume his or her identity in daily life Medical identity theft using anothers identity to obtain medical care or drugs Child identity theftIdentity theft may be used to facilitate or fund other crimes including Illegal immigration terrorism phishing and espionage There are cases of identity cloning to attack payment systems including online credit card processing and medical insurance Identity cloning and concealment In this situation the identity thief impersonates someone else to conceal their own true identity Examples are illegal immigrants hiding their illegal status people hiding from creditors or other individuals and those who simply want to become anonymous for personal reasons Another example is posers a label given to people who use someone elses photos and information on social networking sites Posers mostly create believable stories involving friends of the real person they are imitating Unlike identity theft used to obtain credit which usually comes to light when the debts mount concealment may continue indefinitely without being detected particularly if the identity thief can obtain false credentials to pass various authentication tests in everyday life Criminal identity theft When a criminal fraudulently identifies themselves to police as another individual at the point of arrest it is sometimes referred to as Criminal Identity Theft In some cases criminals have previously obtained stateissued identity documents using credentials stolen from others or have simply presented a fake ID Provided the subterfuge works charges may be placed under the victims name letting the criminal off the hook Victims might only learn of such incidents by chance for example by receiving a court summons discovering their drivers licenses are suspended when stopped for minor traffic violations or through background checks performed for employment purposes It can be difficult for the victim of criminal identity theft to clear their record The steps required to clear the victims incorrect criminal record depend on which jurisdiction the crime occurred and whether the true identity of the criminal can be determined The victim might need to locate the original arresting officers and prove their own identity by some reliable means such as fingerprinting or DNA testing and may need to go to a court hearing to be cleared of the charges Obtaining an expungement of court records may also be required Authorities might permanently maintain the victims name as an alias for the criminals true identity in their criminal records databases One problem that victims of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various data aggregators might still have incorrect criminal records in their databases even after court and police records are corrected Thus a future background check may return the incorrect criminal records This is just one example of the kinds of impact that may continue to affect the victims of identity theft for some months or even years after the crime aside from the psychological trauma that being cloned typically engenders Synthetic identity theft A variation of identity theft that has recently become more common is synthetic identity theft in which identities are completely or partially fabricated The most common technique involves combining a real social security number with a name and birthdate other than the ones that are simply associated with the number Synthetic identity theft is more difficult to track as it doesnt show on either persons credit report directly but may appear as an entirely new file in the credit bureau or as a subfile on one of the victims credit reports Synthetic identity theft primarily harms the creditors who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit Individual victims can be affected if their names become confused with the synthetic identities or if negative information in their subfiles impacts their credit ratings Medical identity theft Privacy researcher Pam Dixon the founder of the World Privacy Forum coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006 In the report she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victims public The reports definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person Insurance theft is also very common if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card they can seek medical attention posing as yourself In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft the thiefs medical history may be added to the victims medical records Inaccurate information in the victims records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors to rely on misinformation to deliver inappropriate care After the publication of the report which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents California passed a law requiring this and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organizations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information Child identity theft Child identity theft occurs when a minors identity is used by another person for the impostors personal gain The impostor can be a family member a friend or even a stranger who targets children The Social Security numbers of children are valued because they do not have any information associated with them Thieves can establish lines of credit obtain drivers licenses or even buy a house using a childs identity This fraud can go undetected for years as most children do not discover the problem until years later Child identity theft is fairly common and studies have shown that the problem is growing The largest study on child identity theft as reported by Richard Power of the Carnegie Mellon Cylab with data supplied by AllClear ID found that of 40000 children 102 were victims of identity theftThe Federal Trade Commission FTC estimates that about nine million people will be victims of identity theft in the United States per year It was also estimated that in 2008 630000 people under the age of 19 were victims of theft This then gave them a debt of about 12799 which was not theirsNot only are children in general big targets of identity theft but children who are in foster care are even bigger targets This is because they are most likely moved around quite frequently and their SSN is being shared with multiple people and agencies Foster children are even more victims of identity theft within their own families and other relatives Young people in foster care who are victims of this crime are usually left alone to struggle and figure out how to fix their newly formed bad credit Financial identity theft The most common type of identity theft is related to finance Financial identity theft includes obtaining credit loans goods and services while claiming to be someone else Tax identity theft One of the major identity theft categories is taxrelated identity theft The most common method is to use a persons authentic name address and Social Security Number to file a tax return with false information and have the resulting refund directdeposited into a bank account controlled by the thief The thief in this case can also try to get a job and then their employer will report the income of the real taxpayer this then results in the taxpayer getting in trouble with the IRSThe 14039 Form to the IRS is a form that will help one fight against a theft like tax theft This form will put the IRS on alert and someone who believed they have been a victim of taxrelated theft will be given an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number IP PIN which is a 6 digit code used in replacing an SSN for filing tax returns Techniques for obtaining and exploiting personal information Identity thieves typically obtain and exploit personally identifiable information about individuals or various credentials they use to authenticate themselves to impersonate them Examples include Rummaging through rubbish for personal information dumpster diving Retrieving personal data from redundant IT equipment and storage media including PCs servers PDAs mobile phones USB memory sticks and hard drives that have been disposed of carelessly at public dump sites given away or sold on without having been properly sanitized Using public records about individual citizens published in official registers such as electoral rolls Stealing bank or credit cards identification cards passports authentication tokens typically by pickpocketing housebreaking or mail theft Commonknowledge questioning schemes that offer account verification such as Whats your mothers maiden name what was your first car model or What was your first pets name Skimming information from bank or credit cards using compromised or handheld card readers and creating clone cards Using contactless credit card readers to acquire data wirelessly from RFIDenabled passports ShoulderSurfing involves an individual who discreetly watches or hears others providing valuable personal information This is particularly done in crowded places because it is relatively easy to observe someone as they fill out forms enter PINs on ATMs or even type passwords on smartphones Stealing personal information from computers using breaches in browser security or malware such as Trojan horse keystroke logging programs or other forms of spyware Hacking computer networks systems and databases to obtain personal data often in large quantities Exploiting breaches that result in the publication or more limited disclosure of personal information such as names addresses Social Security number or credit card numbers Advertising bogus job offers to accumulate resumes and applications typically disclosing applicants names home and email addresses telephone numbers and sometimes their banking details Exploiting insider access and abusing the rights of privileged IT users to access personal data on their employers systems Infiltrating organizations that store and process large amounts or particularly valuable personal information Impersonating trusted organizations in emails SMS text messages phone calls or other forms of communication to dupe victims into disclosing their personal information or login credentials typically on a fake corporate website or data collection form phishing Bruteforce attacking weak passwords and using inspired guesswork to compromise weak password reset questions Obtaining castings of fingers for falsifying fingerprint identification Browsing social networking websites for personal details published by users often using this information to appear more credible in subsequent social engineering activities Diverting victims email or post to obtain personal information and credentials such as credit cards billing and bankcredit card statements or to delay the discovery of new accounts and credit agreements opened by the identity thieves in the victims names Using false pretenses to trick individuals customer service representatives and help desk workers to disclose personal information and login details or changing user passwordsaccess rights pretexting Stealing cheques checks to acquire banking information including account numbers and bank codes Guessing Social Security numbers by using information found on Internet social networks such as Twitter and MySpace Low securityprivacy protection on photos that are easily clickable and downloaded on social networking sites Befriending strangers on social networks and taking advantage of their trust until private information is given Social Engineering Indicators The majority of identity theft victims do not realize that they are a victim until it has negatively impacted their lives Many people do not find out that their identities have been stolen until they are contacted by financial institutions or discover suspicious activities on their bank accounts According to an article by Herb Weisbaum everyone in the US should assume that their personal information has been compromised at one point It is therefore of great importance to watch out for warning signs that your identity has been compromised The following are eleven indicators that someone else might be using your identity Credit or debit card charges for goods or services you are not aware of including unauthorized withdrawals from your account Receiving calls from credit or debit card fraud control department warning of possible suspicious activity on your credit card account Receiving credit cards that you did not apply for Receiving information that a credit scoring investigation was done They are often done when a loan or phone subscription was applied for Checks bouncing for lack of enough money in your account to cover the amount This might be as a result of unauthorized withdrawals from your account Identity theft criminals may commit crimes with your personal information You may not realize this until you see the police on your door arresting you for crimes that you did not commit Sudden changes to your credit score may indicate that someone else is using your credit cards Bills for services like gas water electricity not arriving in time This can be an indication that your mail was stolen or redirected Not being approved for loans because your credit report indicates that you are not credit worthy Receiving notification from your post office informing you that your mails are being forwarded to another unknown address Your yearly tax returns indicating that you have earned more than you have actually earned This might indicate that someone is using your national identification number eg SSN to report their earnings to the tax authorities Individual identity protection The acquisition of personal identifiers is made possible through serious breaches of privacy For consumers this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves eg in a phishing attack but identityrelated documents such as credit cards bank statements utility bills checkbooks etc may also be physically stolen from vehicles homes offices and not the least letterboxes or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers Guardianship of personal identifiers by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the US Federal Trade Commission Canadian Phone Busters and most sites that address identity theft Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information from falling into the wrong hands Identity theft can be partially mitigated by not identifying oneself unnecessarily a form of information security control known as risk avoidance This implies that organizations IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication Requiring storing and processing personal identifiers such as Social Security number national identification number drivers license number credit card number etc increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a wouldbe identity thief from obtaining these records To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System Identity thieves sometimes impersonate dead people using personal information obtained from death notices gravestones and other sources to exploit delays between the death and the closure of the persons accounts the inattentiveness of grieving families and weaknesses in the processes for creditchecking Such crimes may continue for some time until the deceaseds families or the authorities notice and react to anomaliesIn recent years commercial identity theft protectioninsurance services have become available in many countries These services purport to help protect the individual from identity theft or help detect that identity theft has occurred in exchange for a monthly or annual membership fee or premium The services typically work either by setting fraud alerts on the individuals credit files with the three major credit bureaus or by setting up credit report monitoring with the credit bureau While identity theft protectioninsurance services have been heavily marketed their value has been called into question Potential outcomes Identity theft is a serious problem in the United States In a 2018 study it was reported that 60 million Americans identities had been wrongfully acquired In response under advisement from the Identity Theft Resource Center some new bills have been implemented to improve security such as requiring electronic signatures and social security verificationSeveral types of identity theft are used to gather information one of the most common types occurs when consumers make online purchases A study was conducted with 190 people to determine the relationship between the constructs of fear of financial losses and reputational damages The conclusions of this study revealed that identity theft was a positive correlation with reputable damages The relationship between perceived risk and online purchase intention were negative The significance of this study reveals that online companies are more aware of the potential harm that can be done to their consumers therefore they are searching for ways to reduce the perceived risk of consumers and not lose out on business Victims of identity theft may face years of effort proving to the legal system that they are the true person leading to emotional strain and financial losses Most identity theft is perpetrated by a family member of the victim and some may not be able to obtain new credit cards or open new bank accounts or loans Identity protection by organizations In their May 1998 testimony before the United States Senate the Federal Trade Commission FTC discussed the sale of Social Security numbers and other personal identifiers by creditraters and data miners The FTC agreed to the industrys selfregulating principles restricting access to information on credit reports According to the industry the restrictions vary according to the category of customer Credit reporting agencies gather and disclose personal and credit information to a wide business client base Poor stewardship of personal data by organizations resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data can expose individuals to the risk of identity theft The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has documented over 900 individual data breaches by US companies and government agencies since January 2005 which together have involved over 200 million total records containing sensitive personal information many containing social security numbers Poor corporate diligence standards which can result in data breaches include failure to shred confidential information before throwing it into dumpsters failure to ensure adequate network security credit card numbers stolen by call center agents and people with access to call recordings the theft of laptop computers or portable media being carried offsite containing vast amounts of personal information The use of strong encryption on these devices can reduce the chance of data being misused should a criminal obtain them the brokerage of personal information to other businesses without ensuring that the purchaser maintains adequate security controls Failure of governments when registering sole proprietorships partnerships and corporations to determine if the officers listed in the Articles of Incorporation are who they say they are This potentially allows criminals access to personal information through credit rating and data mining servicesThe failure of corporate or government organizations to protect consumer privacy client confidentiality and political privacy has been criticized for facilitating the acquisition of personal identifiers by criminalsUsing various types of biometric information such as fingerprints for identification and authentication has been cited as a way to thwart identity thieves however there are technological limitations and privacy concerns associated with these methods as well Market There is an active market for buying and selling stolen personal information which occurs mostly in darknet markets but also in other black markets People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data and sell it again for a profit increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen Legal responses International In March 2014 after it was learned two passengers with stolen passports were on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 which went missing on 8 March 2014 It came to light that Interpol maintains a database of 40 million lost and stolen travel documents from 157 countries which Interpol makes available to governments and the public including airlines and hotels The Stolen and Lost Travel Documents SLTD database however is rarely used Big News Network which is based in the UAE reported that Interpol SecretaryGeneral Ronald K Noble told a forum in Abu Dhabi in the previous month The bad news is that despite being incredibly costeffective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world only a handful of countries are systematically using SLTD to screen travelers The result is a major gap in our global security apparatus that is left vulnerable to exploitation by criminals and terrorists Australia In Australia each state has enacted laws that deal with different aspects of identity or fraud issues Some states have now amended relevant criminal laws to reflect crimes of identity theft such as the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 SA Crimes Amendment Fraud Identity and Forgery Offences Act 2009 and also in Queensland under the Criminal Code 1899 QLD Other states and territories are in states of development in respect of regulatory frameworks relating to identity theft such as Western Australia in respect of the Criminal Code Amendment Identity Crime Bill 2009 At the Commonwealth level under the Criminal Code Amendment Theft Fraud Bribery Related Offences Act 2000 which amended certain provisions within the Criminal Code Act 1995 1351 General dishonesty 3 A person is guilty of an offense if a the person does anything with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person and b the other person is a Commonwealth entity Penalty Imprisonment for 5 years Between 2014 and 2015 in Australia there were 133921 fraud and deception offences an increase of 6 from previous year The total cost reported by the Attorney General Department was There are also high indirect costs associated as a direct result of an incident For example the total indirect costs for police recorded fraud is 5774081Likewise each state has enacted its own privacy laws to prevent the misuse of personal information and data The Commonwealth Privacy Act applies only to Commonwealth and territory agencies and to certain privatesector bodies where for example they deal with sensitive records such as medical records or they have more than 3 million in turnover PA Canada Under section 4022 of the Criminal Code Everyone commits an offense who knowingly obtains or possesses another persons identity information in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the information is intended to be used to commit an indictable offense that includes fraud deceit or falsehood as an element of the offense is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years or is guilty of an offense punishable on summary conviction Under section 403 of the Criminal Code 1 Everyone commits an offense who fraudulently personates another person living or dead a with intent to gain advantage for themselves or another person b with intent to obtain any property or an interest in any property c with intent to cause disadvantage to the person being personated or another person or d with intent to avoid arrest or prosecution or to obstruct pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years or guilty of an offense punishable on summary conviction In Canada Privacy Act federal legislation covers only federal government agencies and crown corporations Each province and territory has its own privacy law and privacy commissioners to limit the storage and use of personal data For the private sector the purpose of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 c 5 known as PIPEDA is to establish rules to govern the collection use and disclosure of personal information except for the provinces of Quebec Ontario Alberta and British Columbia where provincial laws have been deemed substantially similar Proposed legislation Bill C27 39th Canadian Parliament 2nd Session France In France a person convicted of identity theft can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to 75000 Hong Kong Under HK Laws Chap 210 Theft Ordinance sec 16A Fraud 1 If any person by any deceit whether or not the deceit is the sole or main inducement and with intent to defraud induces another person to commit an act or make an omission which results either a in benefit to any person other than the secondmentioned person or b in prejudice or a substantial risk of prejudice to any person other than the firstmentioned person the firstmentioned person commits the offense of fraud and is liable on conviction upon indictment to imprisonment for 14 years Under the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance it established the post of Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and mandates how much personal information one can collect retain and destroy This legislation also provides citizens the right to request information held by businesses and the government to the extent provided by this law India Under the Information Technology Act 2000 Chapter IX Sec 66C SECTION 66C PUNISHMENT FOR IDENTITY THEFT Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly makes use of the electronic signature password or any other unique identification feature of any other person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to rupees one lakh Philippines Social networking sites are one of the most famous spreaders of posers in the online community giving the users the freedom to post any information they want without any verification that the account is being used by the real personThe Philippines which ranks eighth in the numbers of users of Facebook and other social networking sites such as Twitter Multiply and Tumblr has been known as a source of various identity theft problems Identities of people who carelessly put personal information on their profiles can easily be stolen just by simple browsing Some people meet online get to know each other through Facebook chat and exchange messages that share private information Others get romantically involved with online friends and end up sharing too much information such as their social security number bank account home address and company address This phenomenon leads to the creation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 Republic Act No 10175 Section 2 of this act states that it recognizes the importance of communication and multimedia for the development exploitation and dissemination of information but violators will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of 200000 but not exceeding 1000000 or depending on the damage caused both Sweden Sweden has had relatively few problems with identity theft because only Swedish identity documents were accepted for identity verification Stolen documents are traceable by banks and certain other institutions Banks are required to check the identity of anyone withdrawing money or getting loans If a bank gives money to someone using an identity document that has been reported as stolen the bank must take this loss Since 2008 any EU passport is valid in Sweden for identity verification and Swedish passports are valid all over the EU This makes it harder to detect stolen documents but banks in Sweden still must ensure that stolen documents are not accepted Other types of identity theft have become more common in Sweden One common example is ordering a credit card to someone who has an unlocked letterbox and is not home during the daytime The thief steals the letter with the credit card and the letter with the code which typically arrives a few days later Usage of a stolen credit card is difficult in Sweden since an identity document or a PIN code is normally demanded If a shop does not demand either it must take the loss from accepting a stolen credit card The practice of observing someone using their credit cards PIN code stealing the credit card or skimming it and then using the credit card has become more common Legally Sweden is an open society The Principle of Public Access states that all information eg addresses incomes taxes kept by public authorities must be available for anyone except in certain cases for example the addresses of people who need to hide are restricted This makes fraud easier Until 2016 there were no laws that specifically prohibited using someones identity Instead there were only laws regarding any indirect damages caused Impersonating anyone else for financial gain is a type of fraud in the Criminal Code Swedish brottsbalken Impersonating anyone else to discredit them by hacking into their social media accounts and provoke is considered libel However it is difficult to convict someone of committing this crime In late 2016 a new law was introduced which partially banned undetermined identity usage United Kingdom In the United Kingdom personal data is protected by the Data Protection Act 1998 The Act covers all personal data which an organization may hold including names birthday and anniversary dates addresses and telephone numbers Under English law which extends to Wales but not to Northern Ireland or Scotland the deception offences under the Theft Act 1968 increasingly contend with identity theft situations In R v Seward 2005 EWCA Crim 1941 the defendant was acting as the frontman in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents to obtain goods He obtained goods to the value of 10000 for others who are unlikely ever to be identified The Court of Appeal considered a sentencing policy for deception offenses involving identity theft and concluded that a prison sentence was required Henriques J said at para 14 Identity fraud is a particularly pernicious and prevalent form of dishonesty calling for in our judgment deterrent sentences Statistics released by CIFAS UKs Fraud Prevention Service show that there were 89000 victims of identity theft in the UK in 2010 and 85000 victims in 2009 Men in their 30s and 40s are the most common victims Identity fraud now accounts for nearly half of all frauds recorded United States The increase in crimes of identity theft led to the drafting of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act In 1998 The Federal Trade Commission appeared before the United States Senate The FTC discussed crimes which exploit consumer credit to commit loan fraud mortgage fraud linesofcredit fraud credit card fraud commodities and services frauds The Identity Theft Deterrence Act 2003ITADA amended US Code Title 18 1028 Fraud related to activity in connection with identification documents authentication features and information The statute now makes the possession of any means of identification to knowingly transfer possess or use without lawful authority a federal crime alongside unlawful possession of identification documents However for federal jurisdiction to prosecute the crime must include an identification document that either a is purportedly issued by the United States b is used or intended to defraud the United States c is sent through the mail or d is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce See 18 USC 1028c Punishment can be up to 5 15 20 or 30 years in federal prison plus fines depending on the underlying crime per 18 USC 1028b In addition punishments for the unlawful use of a means of identification were strengthened in 1028A Aggravated Identity Theft allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violations as defined in 1028Ac1 through 11The Act also provides the Federal Trade Commission with authority to track the number of incidents and the dollar value of losses Their figures relate mainly to consumer financial crimes and not the broader range of all identificationbased crimesIf charges are brought by state or local law enforcement agencies different penalties apply to depend on the state Six Federal agencies conducted a joint task force to increase the ability to detect identity theft Their joint recommendation on red flag guidelines is a set of requirements on financial institutions and other entities which furnish credit data to credit reporting services to develop written plans for detecting identity theft The FTC has determined that most medical practices are considered creditors and are subject to requirements to develop a plan to prevent and respond to patient identity theft These plans must be adopted by each organizations board of directors and monitored by senior executivesIdentity theft complaints as a percentage of all fraud complaints decreased from 2004 to 2006 The Federal Trade Commission reported that fraud complaints in general were growing faster than ID theft complaints The findings were similar in two other FTC studies done in 2003 and 2005 In 2003 46 percent of the US population said they were a victim of ID theft In 2005 that number had dropped to 37 percent of the population The commissions 2003 estimate was that identity theft accounted for some 526 billion of losses in the preceding year alone and affected more than 991 million Americans the figure comprises 476 billion lost by businesses and 5 billion lost by consumers According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2010 7 of US households experienced identity theft up from 55 in 2005 when the figures were first assembled but broadly flat since 2007 In 2012 approximately 166 million persons or 7 of all US residents age 16 or older reported being victims of one or more incidents of identity theftAt least two states California and Wisconsin have created an Office of Privacy Protection to assist their citizens in avoiding and recovering from identity theft In 2009 Indiana created an Identity Theft Unit within their Office of Attorney General to educate and assist consumers in avoiding and recovering from identity theft as well as assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting identity theft crimesIn Massachusetts in 20092010 Governor Deval Patrick committed to balancing consumer protection with the needs of small business owners His Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation announced certain adjustments to Massachusetts identity theft regulations that maintain protections and also allow flexibility in compliance These updated regulations went into effect on 1 March 2010 The regulations are clear that their approach to data security is a riskbased approach important to small businesses and might not handle a lot of personal information about customersThe IRS has created the IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit to help taxpayers who are victims of federal taxrelated identity theft Generally the identity thief will use a stolen SSN to file a forged tax return and attempt to get a fraudulent refund early in the filing season A taxpayer will need to fill out Form 14039 Identity Theft AffidavitAs for the future of medical care and Medicaid people are mostly concerned about cloud computing The addition of using cloud information within the United States medicare system would institute easily accessible health information for individuals but that also makes it easier for identity theft Currently new technology is being produced to help encrypt and protect files which will create a smooth transition to cloud technology in the healthcare system Notification Many states followed Californias lead and enacted mandatory data breach notification laws As a result companies that report a data breach typically report it to all their customers Spread and impact Surveys in the US from 2003 to 2006 showed a decrease in the total number of identity fraud victims and a decrease in the total value of identity fraud from US476 billion in 2003 to 156 billion in 2006 The average fraud per person decreased from 4789 in 2003 to 1882 in 2006 A Microsoft report shows that this drop is due to statistical problems with the methodology that such surveybased estimates are hopelessly flawed and exaggerate the true losses by orders of magnitudeThe 2003 survey from the Identity Theft Resource Center found that Only 15 of victims find out about the theft through proactive action taken by a business The average time spent by victims resolving the problem is about 330 hours 73 of respondents indicated the crime involved the thief acquiring a credit cardIn a widely publicized account Michelle Brown a victim of identity fraud testified before a US Senate Committee Hearing on Identity Theft Ms Brown testified that over a year and a half from January 1998 through July 1999 one individual impersonated me to procure over 50000 in goods and services Not only did she damage my credit but she escalated her crimes to a level that I never truly expected she engaged in drug trafficking The crime resulted in my erroneous arrest record a warrant out for my arrest and eventually a prison record when she was booked under my name as an inmate in the Chicago Federal Prison In Australia identity theft was estimated to be worth between A1billion and A4 billion per annum in 2001In the United Kingdom the Home Office reported that identity fraud costs the UK economy 12 billion annually experts believe that the real figure could be much higher although privacy groups object to the validity of these numbers arguing that they are being used by the government to push for introduction of national ID cards Confusion over exactly what constitutes identity theft has led to claims that statistics may be exaggerated An extensively reported study from Microsoft Research in 2011 finds that estimates of identity theft losses contain enormous exaggerations writing that surveys are so compromised and biased that no faith whatever can be placed in

Digital Signature,A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents A valid digital signature on a message gives a recipient confidence that the message came from a sender known to the recipientDigital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites and are commonly used for software distribution financial transactions contract management software and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures which include any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures Electronic signatures have legal significance in some countries including Canada South Africa the United States Algeria Turkey India Brazil Indonesia Mexico Saudi Arabia Uruguay Switzerland Chile and the countries of the European UnionDigital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography In many instances they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a nonsecure channel Properly implemented a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type Digital signature schemes in the sense used here are cryptographically based and must be implemented properly to be effective They can also provide nonrepudiation meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message while also claiming their private key remains secret Further some nonrepudiation schemes offer a timestamp for the digital signature so that even if the private key is exposed the signature is valid Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring examples include electronic mail contracts or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol Definition A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms A key generation algorithm that selects a private key uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key A signing algorithm that given a message and a private key produces a signature A signature verifying algorithm that given the message public key and signature either accepts or rejects the messages claim to authenticityTwo main properties are required First the authenticity of a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key can be verified by using the corresponding public key Secondly it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that partys private key A digital signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attach a code that acts as a signature The Digital Signature Algorithm DSA developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology is one of many examples of a signing algorithm In the following discussion 1n refers to a unary number Formally a digital signature scheme is a triple of probabilistic polynomial time algorithms G S V satisfying G keygenerator generates a public key pk and a corresponding private key sk on input 1n where n is the security parameter S signing returns a tag t on the inputs the private key sk and a string x V verifying outputs accepted or rejected on the inputs the public key pk a string x and a tag tFor correctness S and V must satisfy Pr pk sk G1n V pk x Ssk x accepted 1A digital signature scheme is secure if for every nonuniform probabilistic polynomial time adversary A Pr pk sk G1n x t ASsk pk 1n x Q Vpk x t accepted neglnwhere ASsk denotes that A has access to the oracle Ssk Q denotes the set of the queries on S made by A which knows the public key pk and the security parameter n and x Q denotes that the adversary may not directly query the string x on S History In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first described the notion of a digital signature scheme although they only conjectured that such schemes existed based on functions that are trapdoor oneway permutations Soon afterwards Ronald Rivest Adi Shamir and Len Adleman invented the RSA algorithm which could be used to produce primitive digital signatures although only as a proofofconcept plain RSA signatures are not secure The first widely marketed software package to offer digital signature was Lotus Notes 10 released in 1989 which used the RSA algorithmOther digital signature schemes were soon developed after RSA the earliest being Lamport signatures Merkle signatures also known as Merkle trees or simply Hash trees and Rabin signaturesIn 1988 Shafi Goldwasser Silvio Micali and Ronald Rivest became the first to rigorously define the security requirements of digital signature schemes They described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes and also presented the GMR signature scheme the first that could be proved to prevent even an existential forgery against a chosen message attack which is the currently accepted security definition for signature schemes The first such scheme which is not built on trapdoor functions but rather on a family of function with a much weaker required property of oneway permutation was presented by Moni Naor and Moti Yung Method One digital signature scheme of many is based on RSA To create signature keys generate an RSA key pair containing a modulus N that is the product of two random secret distinct large primes along with integers e and d such that e d 1 mod N where is Eulers totient function The signers public key consists of N and e and the signers secret key contains d Used directly this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to keyonly existential forgery attack To create a forgery the attacker picks a random signature and uses the verification procedure to determine the message m corresponding to that signature In practice however this type of signature is not used directly but rather the message to be signed is first hashed to produce a short digest that is then padded to larger width comparable to N then signed with the reverse trapdoor function This forgery attack then only produces the padded hash function output that corresponds to but not a message that leads to that value which does not lead to an attack In the random oracle model hashthensign an idealized version of that practice where hash and padding combined have close to N possible outputs this form of signature is existentially unforgeable even against a chosenplaintext attackThere are several reasons to sign such a hash or message digest instead of the whole document For efficiency The signature will be much shorter and thus save time since hashing is generally much faster than signing in practice For compatibility Messages are typically bit strings but some signature schemes operate on other domains such as in the case of RSA numbers modulo a composite number N A hash function can be used to convert an arbitrary input into the proper format For integrity Without the hash function the text to be signed may have to be split separated in blocks small enough for the signature scheme to act on them directly However the receiver of the signed blocks is not able to recognize if all the blocks are present and in the appropriate order Applications As organizations move away from paper documents with ink signatures or authenticity stamps digital signatures can provide added assurances of the evidence to provenance identity and status of an electronic document as well as acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory The United States Government Printing Office GPO publishes electronic versions of the budget public and private laws and congressional bills with digital signatures Universities including Penn State University of Chicago and Stanford are publishing electronic student transcripts with digital signatures Below are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications Authentication A message may have letterhead or a handwritten signature identifying its sender but letterheads and handwritten signatures can be copied and pasted onto forged messages Even legitimate messages may be modified in transitIf a banks central office receives a letter claiming to be from a branch office with instructions to change the balance of an account the central bankers need to be sure before acting on the instructions that they were actually sent by a branch banker and not forgedwhether a forger fabricated the whole letter or just modified an existing letter in transit by adding some digits With a digital signature scheme the central office can arrange beforehand to have a public key on file whose private key is known only to the branch office The branch office can later sign a message and the central office can use the public key to verify the signed message was not a forgery before acting on it A forger who doesnt know the senders private key cant sign a different message or even change a single digit in an existing message without making the recipients signature verification failEncryption can hide the content of the message from an eavesdropper but encryption on its own may not let recipient verify the messages authenticity or even detect selective modifications like changing a digitif the banks offices simply encrypted the messages they exchange they could still be vulnerable to forgery In other applications such as software updates the messages are not secretwhen a software author publishes an patch for all existing installations of the software to apply the patch itself is not secret but computers running the software must verify the authenticity of the patch before applying it lest they become victims to malware Limitations Replays A digital signature scheme on its own does not prevent a valid signed message from being recorded and then maliciously reused in a replay attack For example the branch office may legitimately request that bank transfer be issued once in a signed message If the bank doesnt use a system of transaction ids in their messages to detect which transfers have already happened someone could illegitimately reuse the same signed message many times to drain an accountUniqueness and malleability of signatures A signature itself cannot be used to uniquely identify the message it signsin some signature schemes every message has a large number of possible valid signatures from the same signer and it may be easy even without knowledge of the private key to transform one valid signature into another If signatures are misused as transaction ids in an attempt by a banklike system such as a Bitcoin exchange to detect replays this can be exploited to replay transactionsAuthenticating a public key Prior knowledge of a public key can be used to verify authenticity of a signed message but not the other way aroundprior knowledge of a signed message cannot be used to verify authenticity of a public key In some signature schemes given a signed message it is easy to construct a public key under which the signed message will pass verification even without knowledge of the private key that was used to make the signed message in the first place Nonrepudiation Nonrepudiation or more specifically nonrepudiation of origin is an important aspect of digital signatures By this property an entity that has signed some information cannot at a later time deny having signed it Similarly access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature Note that these authentication nonrepudiation etc properties rely on the secret key not having been revoked prior to its usage Public revocation of a keypair is a required ability else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the keypair Checking revocation status requires an online check eg checking a certificate revocation list or via the Online Certificate Status Protocol Very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives creditcards first checking online with the creditcard issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen Of course with stolen key pairs the theft is often discovered only after the secret keys use eg to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose Notions of security In their foundational paper Goldwasser Micali and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures In a keyonly attack the attacker is only given the public verification key In a known message attack the attacker is given valid signatures for a variety of messages known by the attacker but not chosen by the attacker In an adaptive chosen message attack the attacker first learns signatures on arbitrary messages of the attackers choiceThey also describe a hierarchy of attack results A total break results in the recovery of the signing key A universal forgery attack results in the ability to forge signatures for any message A selective forgery attack results in a signature on a message of the adversarys choice An existential forgery merely results in some valid messagesignature pair not already known to the adversaryThe strongest notion of security therefore is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack Additional security precautions Putting the private key on a smart card All public key private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret A private key can be stored on a users computer and protected by a local password but this has two disadvantages the user can only sign documents on that particular computer the security of the private key depends entirely on the security of the computerA more secure alternative is to store the private key on a smart card Many smart cards are designed to be tamperresistant although some designs have been broken notably by Ross Anderson and his students In a typical digital signature implementation the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card whose CPU signs the hash using the stored private key of the user and then returns the signed hash Typically a user must activate their smart card by entering a personal identification number or PIN code thus providing twofactor authentication It can be arranged that the private key never leaves the smart card although this is not always implemented If the smart card is stolen the thief will still need the PIN code to generate a digital signature This reduces the security of the scheme to that of the PIN system although it still requires an attacker to possess the card A mitigating factor is that private keys if generated and stored on smart cards are usually regarded as difficult to copy and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy Thus the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked Private keys that are protected by software only may be easier to copy and such compromises are far more difficult to detect Using smart card readers with a separate keyboard Entering a PIN code to activate the smart card commonly requires a numeric keypad Some card readers have their own numeric keypad This is safer than using a card reader integrated into a PC and then entering the PIN using that computers keyboard Readers with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a keystroke logger potentially compromising the PIN code Specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often EAL3 certified Other smart card designs Smart card design is an active field and there are smart card schemes which are intended to avoid these particular problems despite having few security proofs so far Using digital signatures only with trusted applications One of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user does not see what they sign The user application presents a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key An attacker who gains control of the users PC can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute in effect replacing the users own communications with those of the attacker This could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the users original onscreen but presenting the attackers own documents to the signing application To protect against this scenario an authentication system can be set up between the users application word processor email client etc and the signing application The general idea is to provide some means for both the user application and signing application to verify each others integrity For example the signing application may require all requests to come from digitally signed binaries Using a network attached hardware security module One of the main differences between a cloud based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk Many risk averse companies including governments financial and medical institutions and payment processors require more secure standards like FIPS 1402 level 3 and FIPS 201 certification to ensure the signature is validated and secure WYSIWYS Technically speaking a digital signature applies to a string of bits whereas humans and applications believe that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits In order to be semantically interpreted the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for humans and applications and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system The problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change as a function of the processes used to transform the bits into semantic content It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed WYSIWYS What You See Is What You Sign means that the semantic interpretation of a signed message cannot be changed In particular this also means that a message cannot contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied WYSIWYS is a requirement for the validity of digital signatures but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems The term WYSIWYS was coined by Peter Landrock and Torben Pedersen to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for PanEuropean projects Digital signatures versus ink on paper signatures An ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally but to have credible signature copies that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill and to produce ink signature copies that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult Digital signatures cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature cannot be copied to another document Paper contracts sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page and the previous pages may be replaced after a signature is applied Digital signatures can be applied to an entire document such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the pages have been altered but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all pages of the contract Some digital signature algorithms RSA DSA ECDSA EdDSA RSA with SHA ECDSA with SHA ElGamal signature scheme as the predecessor to DSA and variants Schnorr signature and PointchevalStern signature algorithm Rabin signature algorithm Pairingbased schemes such as BLS NTRUSign is an example of a digital signature scheme based on hard lattice problems Undeniable signatures Aggregate signatureru a signature scheme that supports aggregation Given n signatures on n messages from n users it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single signature whose size is constant in the number of users This single signature will convince the verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n original messages A scheme by Mihir Bellare and Gregory Neven may be used with Bitcoin Signatures with efficient protocols are signature schemes that facilitate efficient cryptographic protocols such as zeroknowledge proofs or secure computation The current state of use legal and practical Most digital signature schemes share the following goals regardless of cryptographic theory or legal provision Quality algorithms Some publickey algorithms are known to be insecure as practical attacks against them have been discovered Quality implementations An implementation of a good algorithm or protocol with mistakes will not work Users and their software must carry out the signature protocol properly The private key must remain private If the private key becomes known to any other party that party can produce perfect digital signatures of anything The public key owner must be verifiable A public key associated with Bob actually came from Bob This is commonly done using a public key infrastructure PKI and the public keyuser association is attested by the operator of the PKI called a certificate authority For open PKIs in which anyone can request such an attestation universally embodied in a cryptographically protected public key certificate the possibility of mistaken attestation is nontrivial Commercial PKI operators have suffered several publicly known problems Such mistakes could lead to falsely signed and thus wrongly attributed documents Closed PKI systems are more expensive but less easily subverted in this wayOnly if all of these conditions are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message and therefore of their assent to its contents Legal enactment cannot change this reality of the existing engineering possibilities though some such have not reflected this actuality Legislatures being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a PKI or by the technological avantgarde advocating new solutions to old problems have enacted statutes andor regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing endorsing encouraging or permitting digital signatures and providing for or limiting their legal effect The first appears to have been in Utah in the United States followed closely by the states Massachusetts and California Other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the UN has had an active model law project for some time These enactments or proposed enactments vary from place to place have typically embodied expectations at variance optimistically or pessimistically with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable Adoption of technical standards for digital signatures have lagged behind much of the legislation delaying a more or less unified engineering position on interoperability algorithm choice key lengths and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide Industry standards Some industries have established common interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures between members of the industry and with regulators These include the Automotive Network Exchange for the automobile industry and the SAFEBioPharma Association for the healthcare industry Using separate key pairs for signing and encryption In several countries a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature as in the 1999 EU digital signature directive and 2014 EU followon legislation Generally these provisions mean that anything digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms therein For that reason it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing Using the encryption key pair a person can engage in an encrypted conversation eg regarding a real estate transaction but the encryption does not legally sign every message he or she sends Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing keys and only then are they legally bound by the terms of a specific document After signing the document can be sent over the encrypted link If a signing key is lost or compromised it can be revoked to mitigate any future transactions If an encryption key is lost a backup or key escrow should be utilized to continue viewing encrypted content Signing keys should never be backed up or escrowed unless the backup destination is securely encrypted See also 21 CFR 11 X509 Advanced electronic signature Blind signature Detached signature Digital certificate Digital signature in Estonia Electronic lab notebook Electronic signature

Cybercrime,Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices andor networks These crimes involve the use of technology to commit fraud identity theft data breaches computer viruses scams and expanded upon in other malicious acts Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks to gain unauthorized access steal sensitive information disrupt services and cause financial or reputational harm to individuals organizations and governmentsIn the year 2000 The Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders placed cyber crimes into five categories unauthorized access damage to computer data or programs sabotage to hinder the functioning of a computer system or network unauthorized interception of data within a system or network and computer espionage Internationally both state and nonstate actors engage in cybercrimes including espionage financial theft and other crossborder crimes Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nationstate are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare Warren Buffett has said that cybercrime is the number one problem with mankind and that it poses real risks to humanityA 2014 report sponsored by McAfee estimated that cybercrime had resulted in 445 billion USD in annual damage to the global economy Approximately 15 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and debit card fraud in the US In 2018 a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS in partnership with McAfee concluded that nearly 1 percent of global gross domestic product GDP close to 600 billion is lost to cybercrime each year The World Economic Forum 2020 Global Risk Report confirmed that organized cybercrime groups are joining forces to commit criminal activities online while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the US There are also many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed legally or otherwise Classifications Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities including computer fraud financial crimes scams cybersex trafficking and adfraud Computer fraud Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data or to gain unlawful use of a computer or system Computer fraud that involves the use of the internet is also called internet fraud The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization Forms of computer fraud include hacking into computers to alter information distributing malicious code such as computer worms or viruses installing malware or spyware to steal data phishing and advancefee scamsOther forms of fraud may be committed using computer systems including bank fraud carding identity theft extortion and theft of classified information These types of crimes often result in the loss of personal or financial information Cyberterrorism The term cyberterrorism refers to acts of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources Acts of disruption of computer networks and personal computers through viruses worms phishing malicious software hardware or programming scripts can all be forms of cyberterrorismGovernment officials and information technology IT security specialists have documented a significant increase in network problems and server scams since early 2001 In the United States there is an increasing concern from agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency CIA Cyberextortion Cyberextortion occurs when a website email server or computer system is subjected to or threatened with attacks by malicious hackers often through denialofservice attacks Cyberextortionists demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and provide protection According to the FBI cyberextortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks crippling their ability to operate and demanding payments to restore their service More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI and many go unreported in order to keep the victims name out of the public domain Perpetrators often use a distributed denialofservice attack However other cyberextortion techniques exist such as doxing and bug poaching An example of cyberextortion was the Sony Hack of 2014 Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malware used in cyberextortion to restrict access to files sometimes threatening permanent data erasure unless a ransom is paid Ransomware is a global issue with more than 300 million attacks worldwide in 2021 According to the 2022 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report in 2021 the average ransom demand in cases handled by Norton climbed 144 percent to 22 million and there was an 85 percent increase in the number of victims who had their personal information shown on dark web information dumps A loss of nearly 400 million in 2021 and 2022 is just one of the statistics showing the impact of ransomware attacks on everyday people Cybersex trafficking Cybersex trafficking is the transportation of victims for such purposes as coerced prostitution or the live streaming of coerced sexual acts or rape on webcam Victims are abducted threatened or deceived and transferred to cybersex dens The dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have a computer tablet or phone with an internet connection Perpetrators use social media networks video conferences dating pages online chat rooms apps dark web sites and other platforms They use online payment systems and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities Millions of reports of cybersex incidents are sent to authorities annually New legislation and police procedures are needed to combat this type of cybercrimeThere are an estimated 63 million victims of cybersex trafficking according to a recent report by the International Labour Organization This number includes about 17 million child victims An example of cybersex trafficking is the 20182020 Nth room case in South Korea Cyberwarfare According to the US Department of Defense cyberspace has emerged as an arena for nationalsecurity threats through several recent events of geostrategic importance including the attack on Estonias infrastructure in 2007 allegedly by Russian hackers In August 2008 Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks against Georgia Fearing that such attacks may become a normal part of future warfare among nationstates military commanders see a need to develop cyberspace operations Computers as a tool When an individual is the target of cybercrime the computer is often the tool rather than the target These crimes which typically exploit human weaknesses usually do not require much technical expertise These are the types of crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world Criminals have simply been given a tool that increases their pool of potential victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehendCrimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include Fraud and identity theft although this increasingly uses malware hacking or phishing making it an example of computer as target as well as computer as tool Information warfare Phishing scams Spam Propagation of illegal obscene or offensive content including harassment and threatsThe unsolicited sending of bulk email for commercial purposes spam is unlawful in some jurisdictions Phishing is mostly propagated via email Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by malware Or they may contain links to fake online banking or other websites used to steal private account information Obscene or offensive content The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful obscene or offensive for a variety of reasons In some instances it may be illegal What content is unlawful varies greatly between countries and even within nations It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs One area of internet pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world Adfraud Adfrauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals as such frauds are lucrative and unlikely to be prosecuted JeanLoup Richet a professor at the Sorbonne Business School classified the large variety of adfrauds committed by cybercriminals into three categories identity fraud attribution fraud and adfraud servicesIdentity fraud aims to impersonate real users and inflate audience numbers The techniques used for identity fraud include traffic from bots coming from a hosting company a data center or compromised devices cookie stuffing falsification of user characteristics such as location and browser type fake social traffic misleading users on social networks into visiting the advertised website and fake social media accounts that make a bot appear legitimate Attribution fraud impersonates the activities of real users such as clicks and conversations Many adfraud techniques belong to this category the use of hijacked and malwareinfected devices as part of a botnet click farms companies where lowwage employees are paid to click or engage in conversations incentivized browsing video placement abuse delivered in display banner slots hidden ads which will never be viewed by real users domain spoofing ads served on a fake website and clickjacking in which the user is forced to click on an ad Adfraud services include all online infrastructure and hosting services that might be needed to undertake identity or attribution fraud Services can involve the creation of spam websites fake networks of websites that provide artificial backlinks link building services hosting services or fake and scam pages impersonating a famous brand Online harassment Whereas content may be offensive in a nonspecific way harassment directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals often focusing on gender race religion nationality or sexual orientation Committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence For example in the case of United States v Neil Scott Kramer the defendant was given an enhanced sentence according to the US Sentencing Guidelines Manual 2G13b3 for his use of a cell phone to persuade induce entice coerce or facilitate the travel of the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct Kramer appealed the sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer Although Kramer tried to argue this point the US Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term computer means an electronic magnetic optical electrochemical or other highspeed data processing device performing logical arithmetic or storage functions and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device In the United States at least 41 states have passed laws and regulations that regard extreme online harassment as a criminal act These acts can also be prosecuted on the federal level because of US Code 18 Section 2261A which states that using computers to threaten or harass can lead to a sentence of up to 20 yearsSeveral countries besides the US have also created laws to combat online harassment In China a country with over 20 percent of the worlds internet users in response to the Human Flesh Search Engine bullying incident the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council passed a strict law against cyberbullying The United Kingdom passed the Malicious Communications Act which states that sending messages or letters electronically that the government deems indecent or grossly offensive andor language intended to cause distress and anxiety can lead to a prison sentence of six months and a potentially large fine Australia while not directly addressing the issue of harassment includes most forms of online harassment under the Criminal Code Act of 1995 Using telecommunication to send threats harass or cause offense is a direct violation of this actAlthough freedom of speech is protected by law in most democratic societies it does not include all types of speech Spoken or written threats can be criminalized because they harm or intimidate This applies to online or networkrelated threats Cyberbullying has increased drastically with the growing popularity of online social networking As of January 2020 44 percent of adult internet users in the United States had personally experienced online harassment Online harassment of children often has negative and even lifethreatening effects According to a 2021 survey 41 percent of children develop social anxiety 37 percent develop depression and 26 percent have suicidal thoughtsThe United Arab Emirates was found to have purchased the NSO Groups mobile spyware Pegasus for mass surveillance and a campaign of harassment of prominent activists and journalists including Ahmed Mansoor Princess Latifa Princess Haya and others Ghada Oueiss was one of the many highprofile female journalists and activists who were targeted She filed a lawsuit against UAE ruler Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with other defendants accusing them of sharing her photos online Drug trafficking Darknet markets are used to buy and sell recreational drugs online Some drug traffickers use encrypted messaging tools to communicate with drug mules or potential customers The dark web site Silk Road which started operations in 2011 was the first major online marketplace for drugs It was permanently shut down in 2014 by the FBI and Europol After Silk Road 20 went down Silk Road 3 Reloaded emerged However it was just an older marketplace named Diabolus Market that used the Silk Road name in order to get more exposure from the Silk Road brands earlier successDarknet markets have had a rise in traffic in recent years for many reasons such as the anonymous purchases and often a system of reviews by other buyers There are many ways in which darknet markets can financially drain individuals Vendors and customers alike go to great lengths to keep their identities a secret while online Commonly used tools for hiding their online presence include virtual private networks VPNs Tails and the Tor Browser Darknet markets entice customers by making them feel comfortable Although people can easily gain access to a Tor browser actually gaining access to an illicit market is not as simple as typing it in on a search engine as one would with Google Darknet markets have special links that change frequently ending in onion as opposed to the typical com net and org domain extensions To add to privacy the most prevalent currency on these markets is Bitcoin which allows transactions to be anonymousA problem that marketplace users sometimes face is exit scamming That is a vendor with a high rating acts as if they are selling on the market and have users pay for products they never receive The vendor then closes their account after receiving money from multiple buyers and never sending what was paid for The vendors all of whom are involved in illegal activities have no reason not to engage in exit scamming when they no longer want to be a vendor In 2019 an entire market known as Wall Street Market allegedly exit scammed stealing 30 million dollars in bitcoinThe FBI has cracked down on these markets In July 2017 the FBI seized one of the biggest markets commonly called Alphabay which reopened in August 2021 under the control of DeSnake one of the original administrators Investigators pose as buyers and order products from darknet vendors in the hope that the vendors leave a trail the investigators can follow In one case an investigator posed as a firearms seller and for six months people purchased from them and provided home addresses The FBI was able to make over a dozen arrests during this sixmonth investigation Another crackdown targeted vendors selling fentanyl and opiates With thousands of people dying each year due to drug overdose investigators have made internet drug sales a priority Many vendors do not realize the extra criminal charges that go along with selling drugs online such as money laundering and illegal use of the mail In 2019 a vendor was sentenced to 10 years in prison after selling cocaine and methamphetamine under the name JetSetLife But despite the large amount of time investigators spend tracking down people in 2018 only 65 suspects who bought and sold illegal goods on some of the biggest markets were identified Meanwhile thousands of transactions take place daily on these markets Notable incidents One of the highestprofile banking computer crimes occurred over a course of three years beginning in 1970 The chief teller at the Park Avenue branch of New Yorks Union Dime Savings Bank embezzled over 15 million from hundreds of accounts A hacking group called MOD Masters of Deception allegedly stole passwords and technical data from Pacific Bell Nynex and other telephone companies as well as several big credit agencies and two major universities The damage caused was extensive one company Southwestern Bell suffered losses of 370000 In 1983 a 19yearold UCLA student used his PC to break into a Defense Department International Communications system Between 1995 and 1998 the Newscorp satellite paytoview encrypted SKYTV service was hacked several times during an ongoing technological arms race between a panEuropean hacking group and Newscorp The original motivation of the hackers was to watch Star Trek reruns in Germany which was something which Newscorp did not have the copyright permission to allow On 26 March 1999 the Melissa worm infected a document on a victims computer then automatically emailed that document and a copy of the virus to other people In February 2000 an individual going by the alias of MafiaBoy began a series of denialofservice attacks against highprofile websites including Yahoo Dell Inc ETRADE eBay and CNN About 50 computers at Stanford University along with computers at the University of California at Santa Barbara were among the zombie computers sending pings in the distributed denialofservice attacks On 3 August 2000 Canadian federal prosecutors charged MafiaBoy with 54 counts of illegal access to computers The Stuxnet worm corrupted SCADA microprocessors particularly the types used in Siemens centrifuge controllers The Russian Business Network RBN was registered as an internet site in 2006 Initially much of its activity was legitimate But apparently the founders soon discovered that it was more profitable to host illegitimate activities and to offer its services to criminals The RBN has been described by VeriSign as the baddest of the bad It provides web hosting services and internet access to all kinds of criminal and objectionable activities that earn up to 150 million in one year It specializes in personal identity theft for resale It is the originator of MPack and an alleged operator of the now defunct Storm botnet On 2 March 2010 Spanish investigators arrested three men suspected of infecting over 13 million computers around the world The botnet of infected computers included PCs inside more than half of the Fortune 1000 companies and more than 40 major banks according to investigators In August 2010 the US Department of Homeland Security shut down the international pedophile ring Dreamboard The website had approximately 600 members and may have distributed up to 123 terabytes of child pornography roughly equivalent to 16000 DVDs To date this is the single largest US prosecution of an international child pornography ring 52 arrests were made worldwide In January 2012 Zapposcom experienced a security breach compromising the credit card numbers personal information and billing and shipping addresses of as many as 24 million customers In June 2012 LinkedIn and eHarmony were attacked and 65 million password hashes were compromised Thirty thousand passwords were cracked and 15 million eHarmony passwords were posted online In December 2012 the Wells Fargo website experienced a denialofservice attack that potentially compromised 70 million customers and 85 million active viewers Other banks thought to be compromised included Bank of America J P Morgan US Bank and PNC Financial Services On 23 April 2013 the Twitter account of the Associated Press was hacked The hacker posted a hoax tweet about fictitious attacks on the White House that they claimed left thenPresident Obama injured The hoax tweet resulted in a brief plunge of 130 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average the removal of 136 billion from the SP 500 index and the temporary suspension of APs Twitter account The Dow Jones later restored its session gains In May 2017 74 countries logged a ransomware cybercrime called WannaCry Illicit access to camera sensors microphone sensors phonebook contacts all internetenabled apps and metadata of mobile telephones running Android and iOS was reportedly provided by Israeli spyware that was found to be in operation in at least 46 nationstates around the world Journalists royalty and government officials were among the targets Earlier accusations that Israeli weapons companies were meddling in international telephony and smartphones have been eclipsed by the 2018 Pegasus spyware revelations In December 2019 US intelligence officials and The New York Times revealed that ToTok a messaging application widely used in the United Arab Emirates is a spying tool for the UAE An investigation revealed that the Emirati government was attempting to track every conversation movement relationship appointment sound and image of those who installed the app on their phones Combating computer crime Due to cybercriminals using the internet for crossborder attacks and crimes the process of prosecuting cybercriminals has been difficult The number of vulnerabilities that a cybercriminal has an opportunity has to exploit has also increased over the years From 2008 to 2014 alone there has been a 1775 increase in vulnerabilities across all online devices The internets expansive reach causes the damage inflicted to people to be magnified since many methods of cybercrime have the opportunity to reach many people The availability of virtual spaces has allowed cybercrime to become an everyday occurrence In 2018 the Internet Crime Complaint Center received 351937 complaints of cybercrime which led to 27 billion lost Investigation In a criminal investigation a computer can be a source of evidence see digital forensics Even when a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a logfile In many countries Internet Service Providers are required by law to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time There are many ways for cybercrime to take place and investigations tend to start with an IP Address trace however that does not necessarily enable detectives to solve a case Different types of hightech crime may also include elements of lowtech crime and vice versa making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law enforcement Methods of cybercrime detective work are dynamic and constantly improving whether in closed police units or in the framework of international cooperation In the United States the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security DHS are government agencies that combat cybercrime The FBI has trained agents and analysts in cybercrime placed in their field offices and headquarters In the DHS the Secret Service has a Cyber Intelligence Section that works to target financial cybercrimes They combat international cybercrime and work to protect institutions such as banks from intrusions and information breaches Based in Alabama the Secret Service and the Alabama Office of Prosecution Services work together to train professionals in law enforcement at the National Computer Forensic Institute The NCFI provides state and local members of the law enforcement community with training in cyber incident response investigation and forensic examination in cyber incident response investigation and forensic examinationBecause cybercriminals commonly use encryption and other techniques to hide their identity and location it can be difficult to trace a perpetrator after a crime is committed so prevention measures are crucial Prevention The Department of Homeland Security also instituted the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation CDM Program The CDM Program monitors and secures government networks by tracking network risks and informing system personnel so that they can take action In an attempt to catch intrusions before the damage is done the DHS created the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services ECS The Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency approves the private partners that provide intrusion detection and prevention services through the ECSCybersecurity professionals have been skeptical of preventionfocused strategies The mode of use of cybersecurity products has also been called into question Shuman Ghosemajumder has argued that individual companies using a combination of products for security is not a scalable approach and has advocated for the use of cybersecurity technology primarily at the platform levelOn a personal level there are some strategies available to defend against cybercrime Keeping your software and operating system update to benefit from security patches Using antivirus software that can detect and remove malicious threats Use strong passwords with a variety of characters that arent easy to guess Refrain from opening attachments from spam emails Do not click on links from spam emails Do not give out personal information over the internet unless you can verify that the destination is safe Contact companies about suspicious requests of your information Legislation Because of weak laws cybercriminals operating from developing countries can often evade detection and prosecution In countries such as the Philippines laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent Cybercriminals can then strike from across international borders and remain undetected Even when identified these criminals can typically avoid being extradited to a country such as the US that has laws that allow for prosecution For this reason agencies such as the FBI have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals For example two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle Washington They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company Upon completion of the interview the suspects were arrested Clever tricks like that are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak laws and limited international cooperation make it impossible otherwiseIn April 2015 thenPresident Barack Obama released an executive order that allows the US to freeze the assets of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the United StatesThe European Union adopted cybercrime directive 201340EU which was elaborated upon in the Council of Europes Convention on CybercrimeIt is not only the US and the European Union that have been introducing measures against cybercrime On 31 May 2017 China announced that its new cybersecurity law was taking effectIn Australia legislation to combat cybercrime includes the Criminal Code Act 1995 the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 Penalties Penalties for computerrelated crimes in New York State can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a Class A misdemeanor such as unauthorized use of a computer up to 3 to 15 years in prison for a Class C felony such as computer tampering in the first degreeHowever some former cybercriminals have been hired as information security experts by private companies due to their inside knowledge of computer crime a phenomenon which theoretically could create perverse incentives A possible counter to this is for courts to ban convicted hackers from using the internet or computers even after they have been released from prison though as computers and the internet become more and more central to everyday life this type of punishment becomes more and more draconian Nuanced approaches have been developed that manage cyber offenders behavior without resorting to total computer or internet bans These approaches involve restricting individuals to specific devices which are subject to monitoring or searches by probation or parole officers Awareness Cybercrime is becoming more of a threat in our society According to Accentures State of Cybersecurity security attacks increased 31 from 2020 to 2021 The number of attacks per company increased from 206 to 270 Due to this rising threat the importance of raising awareness about measures to protect information and the tactics criminals use to steal that information is paramount However despite cybercrime becoming a mounting problem many people are not aware of the severity of this problem This could be attributed to a lack of experience and knowledge of technological issues There are 15 million cyberattacks annually which means that there are over 4000 attacks a day 170 attacks every hour or nearly three attacks every minute with studies showing that only 16 percent of victims had asked the people who were carrying out the attacks to stop Anybody who uses the internet for any reason can be a victim which is why it is important to be aware of how to be protected while online Intelligence As cybercrime proliferated a professional ecosystem evolved to support individuals and groups seeking to profit from cybercrime activities The ecosystem has become quite specialized and includes malware developers botnet operators professional cybercrime groups groups specializing in the sale of stolen content and so forth A few of the leading cybersecurity companies have the skills and resources to follow the activities of these individuals and groups A wide variety of information that can be used for defensive purposes is available from these sources for example technical indicators such as hashes of infected files and malicious IPsURLs as well as strategic information profiling the goals and techniques of the profiled groups Much of it is freely available but consistent ongoing access typically requires a subscription Some in the corporate sector see a crucial role for artificial intelligence in the future development of cybersecurityInterpols Cyber Fusion Center began a collaboration with key cybersecurity players to distribute information on the latest online scams cyber threats and risks to internet users Since 2017 reports on social engineering frauds ransomware phishing and other attacks have been distributed to security agencies in over 150 countries Spread of cybercrime The increasing prevalence of cybercrime has resulted in more attention to computer crime detection and prosecution Hacking has become less complex as hacking communities disseminate their knowledge through the internet Blogs and social networks have contributed substantially to information sharing so that beginners can benefit from older hackers knowledge and advice Furthermore hacking is cheaper than ever Before the cloud computing era in order to spam or scam one needed a variety of resources such as a dedicated server skills in server management network configuration and network maintenance and knowledge of internet service provider standards By comparison a softwareasaservice for mail is a scalable and inexpensive bulk emailsending service for marketing purposes that could be easily set up for spam Cloud computing could help cybercriminals leverage their attacks whether bruteforcing a password improving the reach of a botnet or facilitating a spamming campaign Agencies ASEAN Australian

Penetration Testing,A penetration test colloquially known as a pentest or ethical hacking is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system performed to evaluate the security of the system this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment The test is performed to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the systems features and data as well as strengths enabling a full risk assessment to be completed The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain that goal A penetration test target may be a white box about which background and system information are provided in advance to the tester or a black box about which only basic information other than the company name is provided A gray box penetration test is a combination of the two where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor A penetration test can help identify a systems vulnerabilities to attack and estimate how vulnerable it isSecurity issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce the riskThe UK National Cyber Security Center describes penetration testing as A method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some or all of that systems security using the same tools and techniques as an adversary mightThe goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved activity for any given engagement with the primary goal focused on finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor and informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended mitigation strategiesPenetration tests are a component of a full security audit For example the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration testing on a regular schedule and after system changes Penetration testing also can support risk assessments as outlined in the NIST Risk Management Framework SP 80053Several standard frameworks and methodologies exist for conducting penetration tests These include the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual OSSTMM the Penetration Testing Execution Standard PTES the NIST Special Publication 800115 the Information System Security Assessment Framework ISSAF and the OWASP Testing Guide CREST a not for profit professional body for the technical cyber security industry provides its CREST Defensible Penetration Test standard that provides the industry with guidance for commercially reasonable assurance activity when carrying out penetration tests Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaws in a software system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and documentation for the system The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system There are different types of penetration testing depending upon the goal of the organization which include Network external and internal Wireless Web Application Social Engineering and Remediation Verification History By the mid 1960s growing popularity of timesharing computer systems that made resources accessible over communication lines created new security concerns As the scholars Deborah Russell and G T Gangemi Sr explain The 1960s marked the true beginning of the age of computer security 27 In June 1965 for example several of the USs leading computer security experts held one of the first major conferences on system securityhosted by the government contractor the System Development Corporation SDC During the conference someone noted that one SDC employee had been able to easily undermine various system safeguards added to SDCs ANFSQ32 timesharing computer system In hopes that further system security study would be useful attendees requested studies to be conducted in such areas as breaking security protection in the timeshared system In other words the conference participants initiated one of the first formal requests to use computer penetration as a tool for studying system security 78 At the Spring 1967 Joint Computer Conference many leading computer specialists again met to discuss system security concerns During this conference the computer security experts Willis Ware Harold Petersen and Rein Turn all of the RAND Corporation and Bernard Peters of the National Security Agency NSA all used the phrase penetration to describe an attack against a computer system In a paper Ware referred to the militarys remotely accessible timesharing systems warning that Deliberate attempts to penetrate such computer systems must be anticipated His colleagues Petersen and Turn shared the same concerns observing that online communication systems are vulnerable to threats to privacy including deliberate penetration Bernard Peters of the NSA made the same point insisting that computer input and output could provide large amounts of information to a penetrating program During the conference computer penetration would become formally identified as a major threat to online computer systems 8 The threat that computer penetration posed was next outlined in a major report organized by the United States Department of Defense DoD in late 1967 Essentially DoD officials turned to Willis Ware to lead a task force of experts from NSA CIA DoD academia and industry to formally assess the security of timesharing computer systems By relying on many papers presented during the Spring 1967 Joint Computer Conference the task force largely confirmed the threat to system security that computer penetration posed Wares report was initially classified but many of the countrys leading computer experts quickly identified the study as the definitive document on computer security Jeffrey R Yost of the Charles Babbage Institute has more recently described the Ware report as by far the most important and thorough study on technical and operational issues regarding secure computing systems of its time period In effect the Ware report reaffirmed the major threat posed by computer penetration to the new online timesharing computer systems To better understand system weaknesses the federal government and its contractors soon began organizing teams of penetrators known as tiger teams to use computer penetration to test system security Deborah Russell and G T Gangemi Sr stated that during the 1970s tiger teams first emerged on the computer scene Tiger teams were government and industrysponsored teams of crackers who attempted to break down the defenses of computer systems in an effort to uncover and eventually patch security holes 29 A leading scholar on the history of computer security Donald MacKenzie similarly points out that RAND had done some penetration studies experiments in circumventing computer security controls of early timesharing systems on behalf of the government Jeffrey R Yost of the Charles Babbage Institute in his own work on the history of computer security also acknowledges that both the RAND Corporation and the SDC had engaged in some of the first socalled penetration studies to try to infiltrate timesharing systems in order to test their vulnerability In virtually all these early studies tiger teams successfully broke into all targeted computer systems as the countrys timesharing systems had poor defenses Of early tiger team actions efforts at the RAND Corporation demonstrated the usefulness of penetration as a tool for assessing system security At the time one RAND analyst noted that the tests had demonstrated the practicality of systempenetration as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness and adequacy of implemented data security safeguards In addition a number of the RAND analysts insisted that the penetration test exercises all offered several benefits that justified its continued use As they noted in one paper A penetrator seems to develop a diabolical frame of mind in his search for operating system weaknesses and incompleteness which is difficult to emulate For these reasons and others many analysts at RAND recommended the continued study of penetration techniques for their usefulness in assessing system security 9 Presumably the leading computer penetration expert during these formative years was James P Anderson who had worked with the NSA RAND and other government agencies to study system security In the early 1971 the US Air Force contracted Andersons private company to study the security of its timesharing system at the Pentagon In his study Anderson outlined a number of major factors involved in computer penetration Anderson described a general attack sequence in steps Find an exploitable vulnerability Design an attack around it Test the attack Seize a line in use Enter the attack Exploit the entry for information recoveryOver time Andersons description of general computer penetration steps helped guide many other security experts who relied on this technique to assess timesharing computer system security 9 In the following years computer penetration as a tool for security assessment became more refined and sophisticated In the early 1980s the journalist William Broad briefly summarized the ongoing efforts of tiger teams to assess system security As Broad reported the DoDsponsored report by Willis Ware had showed how spies could actively penetrate computers steal or copy electronic files and subvert the devices that normally guard topsecret information The study touched off more than a decade of quiet activity by elite groups of computer scientists working for the Government who tried to break into sensitive computers They succeeded in every attemptWhile these various studies may have suggested that computer security in the US remained a major problem the scholar Edward Hunt has more recently made a broader point about the extensive study of computer penetration as a security tool Hunt suggests in a recent paper on the history of penetration testing that the defense establishment ultimately created many of the tools used in modern day cyberwarfare as it carefully defined and researched the many ways that computer penetrators could hack into targeted systems 5 Tools A wide variety of security assessment tools are available to assist with penetration testing including freeofcharge free software and commercial software Specialized OS distributions Several operating system distributions are geared towards penetration testing Such distributions typically contain a prepackaged and preconfigured set of tools The penetration tester does not have to hunt down each individual tool which might increase the risk of complicationssuch as compile errors dependency issues and configuration errors Also acquiring additional tools may not be practical in the testers context Notable penetration testing OS examples include BlackArch based on Arch Linux BackBox based on Ubuntu Kali Linux replaced BackTrack December 2012 based on Debian Parrot Security OS based on Debian Pentoo based on Gentoo WHAX based on SlackwareMany other specialized operating systems facilitate penetration testingeach more or less dedicated to a specific field of penetration testing A number of Linux distributions include known OS and application vulnerabilities and can be deployed as targets to practice against Such systems help new security professionals try the latest security tools in a lab environment Examples include Damn Vulnerable Linux DVL the OWASP Web Testing Environment WTW and Metasploitable Software frameworks BackBox Hping Metasploit Project Nessus Nmap OWASP ZAP SAINT w3af Burp Suite Wireshark John the Ripper Hashcat Penetration testing phases The process of penetration testing may be simplified into the following five phases Reconnaissance The act of gathering important information on a target system This information can be used to better attack the target For example open source search engines can be used to find data that can be used in a social engineering attack Scanning Uses technical tools to further the attackers knowledge of the system For example Nmap can be used to scan for open ports Gaining access Using the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases the attacker can use a payload to exploit the targeted system For example Metasploit can be used to automate attacks on known vulnerabilities Maintaining access Maintaining access requires taking the steps involved in being able to be persistently within the target environment in order to gather as much data as possible Covering tracks The attacker must clear any trace of compromising the victim system any type of data gathered log events in order to remain anonymousOnce an attacker has exploited one vulnerability they may gain access to other machines so the process repeats ie they look for new vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them This process is referred to as pivoting Vulnerabilities Legal operations that let the tester execute an illegal operation include unescaped SQL commands unchanged hashed passwords in sourcevisible projects human relationships and old hashing or cryptographic functions A single flaw may not be enough to enable a critically serious exploit Leveraging multiple known flaws and shaping the payload in a way that appears as a valid operation is almost always required Metasploit provides a ruby library for common tasks and maintains a database of known exploits When working under budget and time constraints fuzzing is a common technique that discovers vulnerabilities It aims to get an unhandled error through random input The tester uses random input to access the less often used code paths Welltrodden code paths are usually free of errors Errors are useful because they either expose more information such as HTTP server crashes with full info tracebacksor are directly usable such as buffer overflows Imagine a website has 100 text input boxes A few are vulnerable to SQL injections on certain strings Submitting random strings to those boxes for a while will hopefully hit the bugged code path The error shows itself as a broken HTML page half rendered because of an SQL error In this case only text boxes are treated as input streams However software systems have many possible input streams such as cookie and session data the uploaded file stream RPC channels or memory Errors can happen in any of these input streams The test goal is to first get an unhandled error and then understand the flaw based on the failed test case Testers write an automated tool to test their understanding of the flaw until it is correct After that it may become obvious how to package the payload so that the target system triggers its execution If this is not viable one can hope that another error produced by the fuzzer yields more fruit The use of a fuzzer saves time by not checking adequate code paths where exploits are unlikely Payload The illegal operation or payload in Metasploit terminology can include functions for logging keystrokes taking screenshots installing adware stealing credentials creating backdoors using shellcode or altering data Some companies maintain large databases of known exploits and provide products that automatically test target systems for vulnerabilities Metasploit Nessus Nmap OpenVAS W3af Standardized government penetration test services The General Services Administration GSA has standardized the penetration test service as a prevetted support service to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities and stop adversaries before they impact US federal state and local governments These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services HACS and are listed at the US GSA Advantage websiteThis effort has identified key service providers which have been technically reviewed and vetted to provide these advanced penetration services This GSA service is intended to improve the rapid ordering and deployment of these services reduce US government contract duplication and to protect and support the US infrastructure in a more timely and efficient manner 13245A Penetration Testing is security testing in which service assessors mimic realworld attacks to identify methods for circumventing the security features of an application system or network HACS Penetration Testing Services typically strategically test the effectiveness of the organizations preventive and detective security measures employed to protect assets and data As part of this service certified ethical hackers typically conduct a simulated attack on a system systems applications or another target in the environment searching for security weaknesses After testing they will typically document the vulnerabilities and outline which defenses are effective and which can be defeated or exploited In the UK penetration testing services are standardized via professional bodies working in collaboration with National Cyber Security Centre The outcomes of penetration tests vary depending on the standards and methodologies used There are five penetration testing standards Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual OSSTMM Open Web Application Security Project OWASP National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST00 Information System Security

Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency In many scenarios it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration coordination and communication is therefore vital Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself eg fighting fires rescuing individuals but also the indirect effects eg disruption media interestInternational Organization for Standardization ISO which is the worlds largest developer of international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management principles and guidelines document ISO 310002009 that Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment This again shows the importance of not just good planning but the effective allocation of resources to treat the risk Computer security incident management Today an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team CSIRT due to the rise of internet crime and is a common example of an incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world For example if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system the CSIRT would analyze the situation determine the breadth of the compromise and take corrective action Computer forensics is one task included in this process Currently over half of the worlds hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations TNCs take place in North America 57 23 of attempts take place in Europe Having a wellrounded Computer Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization and is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams Roles Incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team IRT or an incident management team IMT These are often designated beforehand or during the event and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with to restore normal functions Usually as part of the wider management process in private organizations incident management is followed by postincident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization with the view of preventing a repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy This information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy andor its practical implementation In the United States the National Incident Management System developed by the Department of Homeland Security integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework This often results in a higher level of contingency planning exercise and training as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident Root cause analysis Human factors During the root cause analysis human factors should be assessed James Reason conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects of human factors The study found that major incident investigations such as Piper Alpha and Kings Cross Underground Fire made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization There are two types of events active failurean action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accidentand latent or delayed actionevents can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering events that then cause the accident Latent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation Their damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors eg the spring tide the loading difficulties at Zeebrugge harbour etc to breach the systems defences Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely the planning scheduling forecasting designing policymaking etc can have a slow burning effect The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed showing the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening Better improvement action can be applied and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again See also National Incident

Information Security Management,Information security management ISM defines and manages controls that an organization needs to implement to ensure that it is sensibly protecting the confidentiality availability and integrity of assets from threats and vulnerabilities The core of ISM includes information risk management a process that involves the assessment of the risks an organization must deal with in the management and protection of assets as well as the dissemination of the risks to all appropriate stakeholders This requires proper asset identification and valuation steps including evaluating the value of confidentiality integrity availability and replacement of assets As part of information security management an organization may implement an information security management system and other best practices found in the ISOIEC 27001 ISOIEC 27002 and ISOIEC 27035 standards on information security Risk management and mitigation Managing information security in essence means managing and mitigating the various threats and vulnerabilities to assets while at the same time balancing the management effort expended on potential threats and vulnerabilities by gauging the probability of them actually occurring A meteorite crashing into a server room is certainly a threat for example but an information security officer will likely put little effort into preparing for such a threat Just as people dont have to start preparing for the end of the world just because of the existence of a global seed bankAfter appropriate asset identification and valuation have occurred risk management and mitigation of risks to those assets involves the analysis of the following issues Threats Unwanted events that could cause the deliberate or accidental loss damage or misuse of information assets Vulnerabilities How susceptible information assets and associated controls are to exploitation by one or more threats Impact and likelihood The magnitude of potential damage to information assets from threats and vulnerabilities and how serious of a risk they pose to the assets costbenefit analysis may also be part of the impact assessment or separate from it Mitigation The proposed methods for minimizing the impact and likelihood of potential threats and vulnerabilitiesOnce a threat andor vulnerability has been identified and assessed as having sufficient impactlikelihood on information assets a mitigation plan can be enacted The mitigation method is chosen largely depends on which of the seven information technology IT domains the threat andor vulnerability resides in The threat of user apathy toward security policies the user domain will require a much different mitigation plan than the one used to limit the threat of unauthorized probing and scanning of a network the LANtoWAN domain Information security management system An information security management system ISMS represents the collation of all the interrelatedinteracting information security elements of an organization so as to ensure policies procedures and objectives can be created implemented communicated and evaluated to better guarantee the organizations overall information security This system is typically influenced by an organizations needs objectives security requirements size and processes An ISMS includes and lends to risk management and mitigation strategies Additionally an organizations adoption of an ISMS indicates that it is systematically identifying assessing and managing information security risks and will be capable of successfully addressing information confidentiality integrity and availability requirements However the human factors associated with ISMS development implementation and practice the user domain must also be considered to best ensure the ISMS ultimate success Implementation and education strategy components Implementing an effective information security management including risk management and mitigation requires a management strategy that takes note of the following Upperlevel management must strongly support information security initiatives allowing information security officers the opportunity to obtain the resources necessary to have a fully functional and effective education program and by extension information security management system Information security strategy and training must be integrated into and communicated through departmental strategies to ensure all personnel is positively affected by the organizations information security plan A privacy training and awareness risk assessment can help an organization identify critical gaps in stakeholder knowledge and attitude towards security Proper evaluation methods for measuring the overall effectiveness of the training and awareness program ensure policies procedures and training materials remain relevant Policies and procedures that are appropriately developed implemented communicated and enforced mitigate risk and ensure not only risk reduction but also ongoing compliance with applicable laws regulations standards and policies Milestones and timelines for all aspects of information security management help ensure future successWithout sufficient budgetary considerations for all the abovein addition to the money allotted to standard regulatory IT privacy and security issuesan information security management plansystem can not fully succeed Relevant standards Standards that are available to assist organizations with implementing the appropriate programs and controls to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities include the ISOIEC 27000 family of standards the ITIL framework the COBIT framework and OISM3 20 The ISOIEC 27000 family represents some of the most wellknown standards governing information security management and the ISMS and are based on global expert opinion They lay out the requirements for best establishing implementing deploying monitoring reviewing maintaining updating and improving information security management systems ITIL acts as a collection of concepts policies and best practices for the effective management of information technology infrastructure service and security differing from ISOIEC 27001 in only a few ways COBIT developed by ISACA is a framework for helping information security personnel develop and implement strategies for information management and governance while minimizing negative impacts and controlling information security and risk management and OISM3 20 is The Open Groups technologyneutral information security model for

Biometrics,Biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics Biometric authentication or realistic authentication is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance Biometric identifiers are the distinctive measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological characteristics which are related to the shape of the body Examples include but are not limited to fingerprint palm veins face recognition DNA palm print hand geometry iris recognition retina odorscent voice shape of ears and gait Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person including but not limited to mouse movement typing rhythm gait signature behavioral profiling and voice Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of biometricsMore traditional means of access control include tokenbased identification systems such as a drivers license or passport and knowledgebased identification systems such as a password or personal identification number Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledgebased methods however the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information Biometric functionality Many different aspects of human physiology chemistry or behavior can be used for biometric authentication The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors Jain et al 1999 identified seven such factors to be used when assessing the suitability of any trait for use in biometric authentication Biometric authentication is based upon biometric recognition which is an advanced method of recognising biological and behavioural characteristics of an Individual Universality means that every person using a system should possess the trait Uniqueness means the trait should be sufficiently different for individuals in the relevant population such that they can be distinguished from one another Permanence relates to the manner in which a trait varies over time More specifically a trait with good permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching algorithm Measurability collectability relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait In addition acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets Performance relates to the accuracy speed and robustness of technology used see performance section for more details Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substituteProper biometric use is very application dependent Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system First in verification or authentication mode the system performs a onetoone comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be Three steps are involved in the verification of a person In the first step reference models for all the users are generated and stored in the model database In the second step some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold The third step is the testing step This process may use a smart card username or ID number eg PIN to indicate which template should be used for comparison Positive recognition is a common use of the verification mode where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identitySecond in identification mode the system performs a onetomany comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the database falls within a previously set threshold Identification mode can be used either for positive recognition so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used or for negative recognition of the person where the system establishes whether the person is who she implicitly or explicitly denies to be The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as passwords PINs or keys are ineffective The first time an individual uses a biometric system is called enrollment During enrollment biometric information from an individual is captured and stored In subsequent uses biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust The first block sensor is the interface between the real world and the system it has to acquire all the necessary data Most of the times it is an image acquisition system but it can change according to the characteristics desired The second block performs all the necessary preprocessing it has to remove artifacts from the sensor to enhance the input eg removing background noise to use some kind of normalization etc In the third block necessary features are extracted This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a template A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the file size and to protect the identity of the enrollee However depending on the scope of the biometric system original biometric image sources may be retained such as the PIVcards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification PIV of Federal Employees and Contractors FIPS 201During the enrollment phase the template is simply stored somewhere on a card or within a database or both During the matching phase the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates estimating the distance between them using any algorithm eg Hamming distance The matching program will analyze the template with the input This will then be output for a specified use or purpose eg entrance in a restricted area though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep Selection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements In selecting a particular biometric factors to consider include performance social acceptability ease of circumvention andor spoofing robustness population coverage size of equipment needed and identity theft deterrence The selection of a biometric is based on user requirements and considers sensor and device availability computational time and reliability cost sensor size and power consumption Multimodal biometric system Multimodal biometric systems use multiple sensors or biometrics to overcome the limitations of unimodal biometric systems For instance iris recognition systems can be compromised by aging irises and electronic fingerprint recognition can be worsened by wornout or cut fingerprints While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker ie multiple images of an iris or scans of the same finger or information from different biometrics requiring fingerprint scans and using voice recognition a spoken passcodeMultimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially simultaneously a combination thereof or in series which refer to sequential parallel hierarchical and serial integration modes respectively Fusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system In case of feature level fusion the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused Matchingscore level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple classifiers pertaining to different modalities Finally in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as majority voting Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier Therefore fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition resultsSpoof attacks consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems and are a major threat that can curtail their security Multimodal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks but recent studies have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait Performance The discriminating powers of all biometric technologies depend on the amount of entropy they are able to encode and use in matching The following are used as performance metrics for biometric systems False match rate FMR also called FAR False Accept Rate the probability that the system incorrectly matches the input pattern to a nonmatching template in the database It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted In case of similarity scale if the person is an imposter in reality but the matching score is higher than the threshold then he is treated as genuine This increases the FMR which thus also depends upon the threshold value False nonmatch rate FNMR also called FRR False Reject Rate the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected Receiver operating characteristic or relative operating characteristic ROC The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the tradeoff between the FMR and the FNMR In general the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match If the threshold is reduced there will be fewer false nonmatches but more false accepts Conversely a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR A common variation is the Detection error tradeoff DET which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances rarer errors Equal error rate or crossover error rate EER or CER the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves In general the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate Failure to enroll rate FTE or FER the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful This is most commonly caused by lowquality inputs Failure to capture rate FTC Within automatic systems the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly Template capacity the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system History An early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1885 when Juan Vucetich started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by Alphonse Bertillon 18531914 and by Francis Galtons theory of fingerprints and physiognomy According to Lebovic Galtons work led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints phrenology and facial characteristics as part of absolute identification and a key to both inclusion and exclusion of populations Accordingly the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era and a form of soft control The theoretician David Lyon showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control Kelly A Gates identified 911 as the turning point for the cultural language of our present in the language of cultural studies the aftermath of 911 was a moment of articulation where objects or events that have no necessary connection come together and a new discourse formation is established automated facial recognition as a homeland security technology Adaptive biometric systems Adaptive biometric systems aim to autoupdate the templates or model to the intraclass variation of the operational data The twofold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation Recently adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages First with an adaptive biometric system one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process Second it is no longer necessary to enroll again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system Despite these advantages there are several open issues involved with these systems For misclassification error false acceptance by the biometric system cause adaptation using impostor sample However continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani et al Recent advances in emerging biometrics In recent times biometrics based on brain electroencephalogram and heart electrocardiogram signals have emerged An example is finger vein recognition using patternrecognition techniques based on images of human vascular patterns The advantage of this newer technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints However such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time On the portability side of biometric products more and more vendors are embracing significantly miniaturized biometric authentication systems BAS thereby driving elaborate cost savings especially for largescale deployments Operator signatures An operator signature is a biometric mode where the manner in which a person using a device or complex system is recorded as a verification template One potential use for this type of biometric signature is to distinguish among remote users of telerobotic surgery systems that utilize public networks for communication Proposed requirement for certain public networks John Michael Mike McConnell a former vice admiral in the United States Navy a former Director of US National Intelligence and Senior Vice President of Booz Allen Hamilton promoted the development of a future capability to require biometric authentication to access certain public networks in his keynote speech at the 2009 Biometric Consortium Conference A basic premise in the above proposal is that the person that has uniquely authenticated themselves using biometrics with the computer is in fact also the agent performing potentially malicious actions from that computer However if control of the computer has been subverted for example in which the computer is part of a botnet controlled by a hacker then knowledge of the identity of the user at the terminal does not materially improve network security or aid law enforcement activities Animal biometrics Rather than tags or tattoos biometric techniques may be used to identify individual animals zebra stripes blood vessel patterns in rodent ears muzzle prints bat wing patterns primate facial recognition and koala spots have all been tried Issues and concerns Human dignity Biometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authority to put it in Foucauldian terms of discipline and biopower By turning the human subject into a collection of biometric parameters biometrics would dehumanize the person infringe bodily integrity and ultimately offend human dignityIn a wellknown case Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben refused to enter the United States in protest at the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator USVISIT programs requirement for visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of biopolitical tattooing akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust According to Agamben biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating life zoe which is the life common to animals and humans just life and bios which is life in the human context with meanings and purposes Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity For him a new biopolitical relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life zoe depriving them from their humanity bios and biometrics would herald this new world In Dark Matters On the Surveillance of Blackness surveillance scholar Simone Browne formulates a similar critique as Agamben citing a recent study relating to biometrics RD that found that the gender classification system being researched is inclined to classify Africans as males and Mongoloids as females Consequently Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern The increasing commodification of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value Indeed corporations value the biometric characteristics more than the individuals value them Browne goes on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a biometric consciousness that entails informed public debate around these technologies and their application and accountability by the state and the private sector where the ownership of and access to ones own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from ones body data must be understood as a rightOther scholars have emphasized however that the globalized world is confronted with a huge mass of people with weak or absent civil identities Most developing countries have weak and unreliable documents and the poorer people in these countries do not have even those unreliable documents Without certified personal identities there is no certainty of right no civil liberty One can claim his rights including the right to refuse to be identified only if he is an identifiable subject if he has a public identity In such a sense biometrics could play a pivotal role in supporting and promoting respect for human dignity and fundamental rights Privacy and discrimination It is possible that data obtained during biometric enrollment may be used in ways for which the enrolled individual has not consented For example most biometric features could disclose physiological andor pathological medical conditions eg some fingerprint patterns are related to chromosomal diseases iris patterns could reveal sex hand vein patterns could reveal vascular diseases most behavioral biometrics could reveal neurological diseases etc Moreover second generation biometrics notably behavioral and electrophysiologic biometrics eg based on electrocardiography electroencephalography electromyography could be also used for emotion detectionThere are three categories of privacy concerns Unintended functional scope The authentication goes further than authentication such as finding a tumor Unintended application scope The authentication process correctly identifies the subject when the subject did not wish to be identified Covert identification The subject is identified without seeking identification or authentication ie a subjects face is identified in a crowd Danger to owners of secured items When thieves cannot get access to secure properties there is a chance that the thieves will stalk and assault the property owner to gain access If the item is secured with a biometric device the damage to the owner could be irreversible and potentially cost more than the secured property For example in 2005 Malaysian car thieves cut off a mans finger when attempting to steal his MercedesBenz SClass Attacks at presentation In the context of biometric systems presentation attacks may also be called spoofing attacks As per the recent ISOIEC 30107 standard presentation attacks are defined as presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system These attacks can be either impersonation or obfuscation attacks Impersonation attacks try to gain access by pretending to be someone else Obfuscation attacks may for example try to evade face detection and face recognition systems Several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks Surveillance humanitarianism in times of crisis Biometrics are employed by many aid programs in times of crisis in order to prevent fraud and ensure that resources are properly available to those in need Humanitarian efforts are motivated by promoting the welfare of individuals in need however the use of biometrics as a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interests of the groups involved in the particular situation Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most In July 2019 the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis Conflicts that are caused by deeprooted political problems in which the implementation of biometrics may not provide a longterm solution Cancelable biometrics One advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be reissued If a token or a password is lost or stolen it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version This is not naturally available in biometrics If someones face is compromised from a database they cannot cancel or reissue it If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature This renders the persons biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication such as the case with the hacking of securityclearancerelated background information from the Office of Personnel Management OPM in the United States Cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system It was first proposed by Ratha et alCancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive userspecific data If a cancelable feature is compromised the distortion characteristics are changed and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template which is used subsequently Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem In biometric cryptosystem the errorcorrecting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations This ensures a high level of security but has limitations such as specific input format of only small intraclass variations Several methods for generating new exclusive biometrics have been proposed The first fingerprintbased cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov et al Essentially cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines such as Teoh et al and Savvides et al whereas other methods such as Dabbah et al take the advantage of the advancement of the wellestablished biometric research for their recognition frontend to conduct recognition Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies Proposed soft biometrics Soft biometrics are understood as not strict biometrical recognition practices that are proposed in favour of identity cheaters and stealers Traits are physical behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers eg height gender hair color They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably and can be easily faked they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial In other words despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject they are effective in distinguishing between people Combinations of personal attributes like gender race eye color height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics First some of soft biometric traits are strongly cultural based eg skin colors for determining ethnicity risk to support racist approaches biometric sex recognition at the best recognizes gender from tertiary sexual characters being unable to determine genetic and chromosomal sexes soft biometrics for aging recognition are often deeply influenced by ageist stereotypes etc Second soft biometrics have strong potential for categorizing and profiling people so risking of supporting processes of stigmatization and exclusion Data protection of biometric data in international law Many countries including the United States are planning to share biometric data with other nations In testimony before the US House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Homeland Security on biometric identification in 2009 Kathleen Kraninger and Robert A Mocny commented on international cooperation and collaboration with respect to biometric data as follows To ensure we can shut down terrorist networks before they ever get to the United States we must also take the lead in driving international biometric standards By developing compatible systems we will be able to securely share terrorist information internationally to bolster our defenses Just as we are improving the way we collaborate within the US Government to identify and weed out terrorists and other dangerous people we have the same obligation to work with our partners abroad to prevent terrorists from making any move undetected Biometrics provide a new way to bring terrorists true identities to light stripping them of their greatest advantageremaining unknown According to an article written in 2009 by S Magnuson in the National Defense Magazine entitled Defense Department Under Pressure to Share Biometric Data the United States has bilateral agreements with other nations aimed at sharing biometric data To quote that article Miller a consultant to the Office of Homeland Defense and Americas security affairs said the United States has bilateral agreements to share biometric data with about 25 countries Every time a foreign leader has visited Washington during the last few years the State Department has made sure they sign such an agreement Likelihood of full governmental disclosure Certain members of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming In particular the Unclassified Report of the United States Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Biometrics states that it is wise to protect and sometimes even to disguise the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of securityrelated activities This also potentially applies to Biometrics It goes on to say that this is a classic feature of intelligence and military operations In short the goal is to preserve the security of sources and methods Countries applying biometrics Countries using biometrics include Australia Brazil Bulgaria Canada Cyprus Greece China Gambia Germany India Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Malaysia Netherlands New Zealand Nigeria Norway Pakistan Poland South Africa Saudi Arabia Tanzania Turkey Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States and Venezuela Among low to middle income countries roughly 12 billion people have already received identification through a biometric identification programThere are also numerous countries applying biometrics for voter registration and similar electoral purposes According to the International IDEAs ICTs in Elections Database some of the countries using 2017 Biometric Voter Registration BVR are Armenia Angola Bangladesh Bhutan Bolivia Brazil Burkina Faso Cambodia Cameroon Chad Colombia Comoros Congo Democratic Republic of Costa Rica Ivory Coast Dominican Republic Fiji Gambia Ghana Guatemala India Iraq Kenya Lesotho Liberia Malawi Mali Mauritania Mexico Morocco Mozambique Namibia Nepal Nicaragua Nigeria Panama Peru Philippines Senegal Sierra Leone Solomon Islands Somaliland Swaziland Tanzania Uganda Uruguay Venezuela Yemen Zambia and Zimbabwe Indias national ID program Indias national ID program called Aadhaar is the largest biometric database in the world It is a biometricsbased digital identity assigned for a persons lifetime verifiable online instantly in the public domain at any time from anywhere in a paperless way It is designed to enable government agencies to deliver a retail public service securely based on biometric data fingerprint iris scan and face photo along with demographic data name age gender address parentspouse name mobile phone number of a person The data is transmitted in encrypted form over the internet for authentication aiming to free it from the limitations of physical presence of a person at a given place About 550 million residents have been enrolled and assigned 480 million Aadhaar national identification numbers as of 7 November 2013 It aims to cover the entire population of 12 billion in a few years However it is being challenged by critics over privacy concerns and possible transformation of the state into a surveillance state or into a Banana republic The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures To tackle the fear amongst the people Indias supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right On 24 August 2017 this new law was established Malaysias MyKad national ID program The current identity card known as MyKad was introduced by the National Registration Department of Malaysia on 5 September 2001 with Malaysia becoming the first country in the world to use an identification card that incorporates both photo identification and fingerprint biometric data on a builtin computer chip embedded in a piece of plastic Besides the main purpose of the card as a validation tool and proof of citizenship other than the birth certificate MyKad also serves as a valid drivers license an ATM card an electronic purse and a public key among other applications as part of the Malaysian Government Multipurpose Card GMPC initiative if the bearer chooses to activate the functions See also Notes References Further reading Biometrics Glossary

Information Privacy,Information privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data technology the public expectation of privacy contextual information norms and the legal and political issues surrounding them It is also known as data privacy or data protection Data privacy is challenging since it attempts to use data while protecting an individuals privacy preferences and personally identifiable information The fields of computer security data security and information security all design and use software hardware and human resources to address this issue Authorities Laws Authorities by country Information types Various types of personal information often come under privacy concerns Cable television This describes the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over cable television and who can access that information For example third parties can track IP TV programs someone has watched at any given time The addition of any information in a broadcasting stream is not required for an audience rating survey additional devices are not requested to be installed in the houses of viewers or listeners and without the necessity of their cooperations audience ratings can be automatically performed in realtime Educational In the United Kingdom in 2012 the Education Secretary Michael Gove described the National Pupil Database as a rich dataset whose value could be maximised by making it more openly accessible including to private companies Kelly Fiveash of The Register said that this could mean a childs school life including exam results attendance teacher assessments and even characteristics could be available with thirdparty organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations was for analysis on sexual exploitation Financial Information about a persons financial transactions including the amount of assets positions held in stocks or funds outstanding debts and purchases can be sensitive If criminals gain access to information such as a persons accounts or credit card numbers that person could become the victim of fraud or identity theft Information about a persons purchases can reveal a great deal about that persons history such as places they have visited whom they have contact with products they have used their activities and habits or medications they have used In some cases corporations may use this information to target individuals with marketing customized towards those individuals personal preferences which that person may or may not approve Internet The ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet and who can access that information has become a growing concern These concerns include whether email can be stored or read by third parties without consent or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone visited Another concern is if websites one visited can collect store and possibly share personally identifiable information about users The advent of various search engines and the use of data mining created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace called the Fair Information Practice Principles To avoid giving away too much personal information emails should be encrypted Browsing of web pages as well as other online activities should be done traceless via anonymizers in case those are not trusted by opensource distributed anonymizers so called mix nets such as I2P or Tor The Onion Router VPNs Virtual Private Networks are another anonymizer that can be used to give someone more protection while online This includes obfuscating and encrypting web traffic so that other groups cannot see or mine itEmail is not the only internet content with privacy concerns In an age where increasing amounts of information is online social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others referred to as participatory surveillance Data about location can also be accidentally published for example when someone posts a picture with a store as a background Caution should be exercised when posting information online social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information worst case leading to cases of cyberstalking or reputation damageCookies are used in websites that users may allow the website to retrieve some information from users internet which it usually does not mention what the data being retrieved is In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR passed regulation that forces websites to visibly disclose to consumers their information privacy practices referred to as cookie noticesThis was issued to give consumers the choice of what information about their behavior they consent to letting websites track however its effectiveness is controversial Some websites may engage in deceptive practices such as placing the cookie notices in places on the page that are not visible or only giving consumers notice that their information is being tracked but not allowing them to change their privacy settingsApps like Instagram and Facebook collect user data for a personalised app experience however they track user activity on other apps which jeopardises users privacy and data By controlling how visible these cookie notices are companies can discreetly collect data giving them more power over the consumers Locational As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing locationbased services problems related to user privacy arise Location data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected A list of potentially sensitive professional and personal information that could be inferred about an individual knowing only their mobility trace was published in 2009 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation These include the movements of a competitor sales force attendance of a particular church or an individuals presence in a motel or at an abortion clinic A recent MIT study by de Montjoye et al showed that four spatiotemporal points approximate places and times are enough to uniquely identify 95 of 15 million people in a mobility database The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low Therefore even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity Medical People may not wish for their medical records to be revealed to others due to the confidentiality and sensitivity of what the information could reveal about their health For example they might be concerned that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment Or it may be because they would not wish for others to know about any medical or psychological conditions or treatments that would bring embarrassment upon themselves Revealing medical data could also reveal other details about ones personal life There are three major categories of medical privacy informational the degree of control over personal information physical the degree of physical inaccessibility to others and psychological the extent to which the doctor respects patients cultural beliefs inner thoughts values feelings and religious practices and allows them to make personal decisions Physicians and psychiatrists in many cultures and countries have standards for doctorpatient relationships which include maintaining confidentiality In some cases the physicianpatient privilege is legally protected These practices are in place to protect the dignity of patients and to ensure that patients feel free to reveal complete and accurate information required for them to receive the correct treatment To view the United States laws on governing privacy of private health information see HIPAA and the HITECH Act The Australian law is the Privacy Act 1988 Australia as well as statebased health records legislation Political Political privacy has been a concern since voting systems emerged in ancient times The secret ballot is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political views are not known to anyone other than the voters themselvesit is nearly universal in modern democracy and considered to be a basic right of citizenship In fact even where other rights of privacy do not exist this type of privacy very often does There are several forms of voting fraud or privacy violations possible with the use of digital voting machines Legality The legal protection of the right to privacy in general and of data privacy in particular varies greatly around the worldLaws and regulations related to Privacy and Data Protection are constantly changing it is seen as important to keep abreast of any changes in the law and to continually reassess compliance with data privacy and security regulations Within academia Institutional Review Boards function to assure that adequate measures are taken to ensure both the privacy and confidentiality of human subjects in researchPrivacy concerns exist wherever personally identifiable information or other sensitive information is collected stored used and finally destroyed or deleted in digital form or otherwise Improper or nonexistent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues Informed consent mechanisms including dynamic consent are important in communicating to data subjects the different uses of their personally identifiable information Data privacy issues may arise in response to information from a wide range of sources such as Healthcare records Criminal justice investigations and proceedings Financial institutions and transactions Biological traits such as genetic material Residence and geographic records Privacy breach Locationbased service and geolocation Web surfing behavior or user preferences using persistent cookies Academic research Protection of privacy in information systems As heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared policy appliances will be required to reconcile enforce and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules and laws There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in commercial IT systems communication and enforcement Policy communicationP3P The Platform for Privacy Preferences P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individualsPolicy enforcementXACML The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machinereadable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems EPAL The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML but is not yet a standard WSPrivacy Web Service Privacy will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in web services For example it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the SOAP envelope of a web service messageProtecting privacy on the internetOn the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves unencrypted emails can be read by the administrators of an email server if the connection is not encrypted no HTTPS and also the internet service provider and other parties sniffing the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents The same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet including web browsing instant messaging and others In order not to give away too much personal information emails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done traceless via anonymizers or by open source distributed anonymizers socalled mix networks Wellknown opensource mix nets include I2P The Anonymous Network and Tor Improving privacy through individualizationComputer privacy can be improved through individualization Currently security messages are designed for the average user ie the same message for everyone Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security nudges crafted based on users individual differences and personality traits can be used for further improvements for each persons compliance with computer security and privacy United States Safe Harbor program and passenger name record issues The United States Department of Commerce created the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles certification program in response to the 1995 Directive on Data Protection Directive 9546EC of the European Commission Both the United States and the European Union officially state that they are committed to upholding information privacy of individuals but the former has caused friction between the two by failing to meet the standards of the EUs stricter laws on personal data The negotiation of the Safe Harbor program was in part to address this longrunning issue Directive 9546EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the European Economic Area to countries which provide adequate privacy protection Historically establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 9546EU Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual Article 261a they are limited in practical scope As a result Article 25 created a legal risk to organizations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States The program regulates the exchange of passenger name record information between the EU and the US According to the EU directive personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection Some exceptions to this rule are provided for instance when the controller themself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules The European Commission has set up the Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data commonly known as the Article 29 Working Party The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countriesThe Working Party negotiated with US representatives about the protection of personal data the Safe Harbor Principles were the result Notwithstanding that approval the selfassessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentatorsThe Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way rather than a blanket law imposed on all organizations in the United States a voluntary program is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission US organizations which register with this program having selfassessed their compliance with a number of standards are deemed adequate for the purposes of Article 25 Personal information can be sent to such organizations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data for the purposes of Article 256 by the European Commission on 26 July 2000Under the Safe Harbor adoptee organizations need to carefully consider their compliance with the onward transfer obligations where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor and then onward to a third country The alternative compliance approach of binding corporate rules recommended by many EU privacy regulators resolves this issue In addition any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulatorsIn July 2007 a new controversial Passenger Name Record agreement between the US and the EU was made A short time afterwards the Bush administration gave exemption for the Department of Homeland Security for the Arrival and Departure Information System ADIS and for the Automated Target System from the 1974 Privacy ActIn February 2008 Jonathan Faull the head of the EUs Commission of Home Affairs complained about the US bilateral policy concerning PNR The US had signed in February 2008 a memorandum of understanding MOU with the Czech Republic in exchange of a visa waiver scheme without concerting before with Brussels The tensions between Washington and Brussels are mainly caused by a lesser level of data protection in the US especially since foreigners do not benefit from the US Privacy Act of 1974 Other countries approached for bilateral MOU included the United Kingdom Estonia Germany and Greece See also Computer science specific Organisations Scholars working in the field References Further reading Philip E Agre Marc Rotenberg 1998 Technology and privacy

Web Application Security,Application security short AppSec includes all tasks that introduce a secure software development life cycle to development teams Its final goal is to improve security practices and through that to find fix and preferably prevent security issues within applications It encompasses the whole application life cycle from requirements analysis design implementation verification as well as maintenanceWeb application security is a branch of information security that deals specifically with the security of websites web applications and web services At a high level web application security draws on the principles of application security but applies them specifically to the internet and web systemsWeb Application Security Tools are specialized tools for working with HTTP traffic eg Web application firewalls Approaches Different approaches will find different subsets of the security vulnerabilities lurking in an application and are most effective at different times in the software lifecycle They each represent different tradeoffs of time effort cost and vulnerabilities found Design review Before code is written the applications architecture and design can be reviewed for security problems A common technique in this phase is the creation of a threat model Whitebox security review or code review This is a security engineer deeply understanding the application through manually reviewing the source code and noticing security flaws Through comprehension of the application vulnerabilities unique to the application can be found Blackbox security audit This is only through the use of an application testing it for security vulnerabilities no source code is required Automated Tooling Many security tools can be automated through inclusion into the development or testing environment Examples of those are automated DASTSAST tools that are integrated into code editor or CICD platforms Coordinated vulnerability platforms These are hackerpowered application security solutions offered by many websites and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs Security threats The Open Web Application Security Project OWASP provides free and open resources It is led by a nonprofit called The OWASP Foundation The OWASP Top 10 2017 results from recent research based on comprehensive data compiled from over 40 partner organizations This data revealed approximately 23 million vulnerabilities across over 50000 applications According to the OWASP Top 10 2021 the ten most critical web application security risks include Broken access control Cryptographic Failures Injection Insecure Design Security Misconfiguration Vulnerable and Outdated Components Identification and Authentification Failures Software and Data Integrity Failures Security Logging and Monitoring Failures ServerSide Request Forgery SSRF Tooling for security testing Security testing techniques scour for vulnerabilities or security holes in applications These vulnerabilities leave applications open to exploitation Ideally security testing is implemented throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle SDLC so that vulnerabilities may be addressed in a timely and thorough manner There are many kinds of automated tools for identifying vulnerabilities in applications Common tool categories used for identifying application vulnerabilities include Static Application Security Testing SAST analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities during an applications development Compared to DAST SAST can be utilized even before the application is in an executable state As SAST has access to the full source code it is a whitebox approach This can yield more detailed results but can result in many false positives that need to be manually verified Dynamic Application Security Testing DAST often called Vulnerability scanners automatically detects vulnerabilities by crawling and analyzing websites This method is highly scalable easily integrated and quick DAST tools are well suited for dealing with lowlevel attacks such as injection flaws but are not well suited to detect highlevel flaws eg logic or business logic flaws Fuzzing tools are commonly used for input testing Interactive Application Security Testing IAST assesses applications from within using software instrumentation This combines the strengths of both SAST and DAST methods as well as providing access to code HTTP traffic library information backend connections and configuration information Some IAST products require the application to be attacked while others can be used during normal quality assurance testing Runtime application selfprotection augments existing applications to provide intrusion detection and prevention from within an application runtime Dependency scanners also called Software Composition Analysis try to detect the usage of software components with known vulnerabilities These tools can either work ondemand eg during the source code build process or periodically Abstraction is the idea of making more complex things less complexResin is a new tool for improving application security and reducing vulnerabilities It allows developers to specify rules about how data should flow through an application to prevent security issues This is done using policy objects to define the rules data tracking to monitor the data flow and filter objects to check the rules at specific points in the data flow Security standards and regulations CERT Secure Coding ISOIEC 2703412011

Data Security,Computer security cybersecurity digital security or information technology security IT security is the protection of computer systems and networks from attacks by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure theft of or damage to hardware software or data as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provideThe field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and WiFi Also due to the growth of smart devices including smartphones televisions and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things IoT Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern largescale systems with farreaching physical effects such as power distribution elections and finance Vulnerabilities and attacks A vulnerability is a weakness in design implementation operation or internal control of a computer or system Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE database An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists Vulnerabilities can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tools or customized scriptsVarious people or parties are vulnerable to cyber attacks however different groups are likely to experience different types of attacks more than othersIn April 2023 the United Kingdom Department for Science Innovation Technology realised a report on cyber attacks over the last 12 months They surveyed 2263 UK businesses 1174 UK registered charities and 554 education institutions The research found that 32 of businesses and 24 of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months This figures were much higher for medium businesses 59 large businesses 69 and highincome charities with 500000 or more in annual income 56 Yet although medium or large businesses are more often the victims since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize businesses SMBs have also become increasing vulnerable as they often do not have advanced tools to defend the business SMBs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attacks and Denialof Service DoS AttacksNormal people working for a business or simply using the internet are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyber attacks These are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices services or users as possible They do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the Internet These strategies mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanningTo secure a computer system it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories Backdoor A backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls These weaknesses may exist for many reasons including original design or poor configuration Due to the nature of backdoors they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals Backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons However criminals often use malware to install backdoors giving them remote administrative access to a system Once they have access cybercriminals can modify files steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computerBackdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who has access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer Denialofservice attack Denial of service attacks DoS are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users Attackers can deny service to individual victims such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many forms of Distributed denial of service DDoS attacks are possible where the attack comes from a large number of points and defending is much more difficult Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques including distributed reflective denial of service DRDoS where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim With such attacks the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks see the attacker motivation section Directaccess attacks A directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gains physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or to steal information Attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications installing software worms keyloggers covert listening devices or using wireless microphones Even when the system is protected by standard security measures these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CDROM or other bootable media Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks Direct service attackers are related in concept to direct memory attacks that allows an attacker to gain direct access to a computers memory The attacks take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allow certain devices such as external hard drives graphics cards or network cards to access the computers memory directlyTo help prevent these attacks computer users must ensure that they have a strong passwords that their computer is locked at all times when they are not using it and that they keep their computer with them at all times when traveling Eavesdropping Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between hosts on a network It typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited Data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods Unlike malware directaccess attacks or other forms of cyber attacks eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices making them difficult to notice In fact the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all He or she can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined timeUsing a virtual private network VPN which encrypts data between two points is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping Using the best form of encryption possible for wireless networks is best practice as well as using HTTPS instead of unencrypted HTTPPrograms such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers Even machines that operate as a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks Malware Malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users Once present on a computer it can leak sensitive details such as personal information business information and passwords can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently Another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victims machine encrypts their files and then turns around and demands a ransom usually in Bitcoin to return that data to the userTypes of malware include some of the following Viruses are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijacks software with the intension to do damage and spread copies of itself Copies are made with the aim to spread to other programs on a computer Worms are similar to viruses however viruses can only function when a user runs opens a comprised program Worms therefore are selfreplicating malware that spread between programs apps and devices without the need for human interaction Trojan horses are programs that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick users into installing them Once installed a RAT remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device Spyware is a type of malware that secretly gathers information on an infected computers and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker One of the most common forms of spyware are known as keyloggers which is a kind of malware which recorders all of a users keyboard inputskeystrokes used to allow hackers to harvest usernames passwords bank account and credit card numbers Scareware as the name suggests is a form of malware which uses social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying or installing unwanted software These attacks often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device has a virus Multivector polymorphic attacks Surfacing in 2017 a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threats combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread Multivector polymorphic attacks as the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic Firstly they are a singular offensive that involves multiple methods of attack In this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the Web email and applications However they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network The attacks can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses worms or trojans constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defences Phishing Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames passwords and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one The fake website often asks for personal information such as login details and passwords This information can then be used to gain access to the individuals real account on the real website Preying on a victims trust phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts A common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices to individuals showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized A more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverages personal or organizationspecific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source Spearphishing attacks target specific individuals rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts Privilege escalation Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privileges or access level For example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system The severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amounts of data Privilege escalation usually starts with social engineering techniques often phishingPrivilege escalation can be separated into to strategies horizontal and vertical privilege escalation Horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gains access to a normal user account that has relatively lowlevel privileges This may be through stealing the users username and password Once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of users at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege Vertical escalation however targets people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such as an employee in IT with a higher privilege Using this privileged account will then enable to attacker to invade other accounts Sidechannel attack Any computational system affects its environment in some form This effect it has on its environment includes a wide range of criteria which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequence make a Cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation faults that allow for access and or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible In Sidechannel attack scenarios the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure Social engineering Social engineering in the context of computer security aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords card numbers etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer This generally involves exploiting peoples trust and relying on their cognitive biases A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action One of the main techniques of social engineering are phishing attacks In early 2016 the FBI reported that such business email compromise BEC scams had cost US businesses more than 2 billion in about two yearsIn May 2016 the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the teams president Peter Feigin resulting in the handover of all the teams employees 2015 W2 tax forms Spoofing Spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such as an IP address or username in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain Spoofing is closely related to phishing There are several types of spoofing including Email spoofing is where an attacker forges the sending From or source address of an email IP address spoofing where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system MAC spoofing where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control MAC address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose as another Biometric spoofing where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user Address Resolution Protocol ARP spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their Media Access Control address with a different hosts IP address This causes data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended hostIn 2018 the cybersecurity firm Trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry Tampering Tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data An intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system components of systems its intended behavior or data Socalled Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples HTML smuggling HTML smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular HTML or web page HTML files can carry payloads concealed as benign inert data in order to defeat content filters These payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filterWhen a target user opens the HTML the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the targets device Information security culture Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization Information security culture is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kindsAndersson and Reimers 2014 found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organizations information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes Indeed the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2020 which examined 3950 security breaches discovered 30 of cybersecurity incidents involved internal actors within a company Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change authors commented Its a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance To manage the information security culture five steps should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation Preevaluation To identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies Strategic planning To come up with a better awareness program clear targets need to be set Assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it Operative planning A good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program Implementation Four stages should be used to implement the information security culture They areCommitment of the management Communication with organizational members Courses for all organizational members Commitment of the employeesPostevaluation To assess the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved areas of concern Computer protection countermeasures In computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be takenSome common countermeasures are listed in the following sections Security by design Security by design or alternately secure by design means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure In this case security is considered a main feature The UK governments National Cyber Security Centre separate secure cyber design principles into five sections Before a secure system is created or updated companies should ensure they understand the fundamentals and the context around the system they are trying to create and to identify any apart weaknesses in a system Companies should design and centre their security around techniques and defences which make attacking their data or systems inherently more challenging for attackers Companies should ensure that their core services that rely on technology are protected so that the technology is always available Although systems can be created which are safe against a multitude of attacks that does not mean that attacks will not be attempted Despite ones security all companies systems should aim to be able to detect and spot attacks as soon as they occur to ensure the most effective response to them Companies should create secure systems designed so that any attack that is successful has a loss severityThese design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques The principle of least privilege where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function That way even if an attacker gains access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system Automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems Code reviews and unit testing approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible Defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds Default secure settings and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering Ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure Audit trails track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined Storing audit trails remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruders from covering their tracks Full disclosure of all vulnerabilities to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered Security architecture Security architecture can be defined as the practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals These goals have overlap with the principles of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise In practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new changes are safe and meet the security requirements of the organisationSimilarly Techopedia defines security architecture as a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment It also specifies when and where to apply security controls The design process is generally reproducible The key attributes of security architecture are the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other determination of controls based on risk assessment good practices finances and legal matters the standardization of controlsPracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business IT and security concerns in an organization Security measures A state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of the three processes threat prevention detection and response These processes are based on various policies and system components which include the following Limiting the access of individuals using user account access controls and using cryptography can protect systems files and data respectively Firewalls are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can if properly configured shield access to internal network services and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering Firewalls can be both hardware and softwarebased Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network Intrusion Detection System IDS products are designed to detect network attacks inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trails and logs serve a similar function for individual systems Response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of legal authorities counterattacks and the like In some special cases the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected Cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threats and attacks Forward web proxy solutions can prevent the client to visit malicious web pages and inspect the content before downloading to the client machinesToday computer security consists mainly of preventive measures like firewalls or an exit procedure A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such as the Internet They can be implemented as software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most UNIXbased operating systems such as Linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking Another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the Internet Some organizations are turning to big data platforms such as Apache Hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threatsIn order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known as the CIA triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security To achieve those objectives administrative physical and technical security measures should be employed The amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known Vulnerability management Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities especially in software and firmware Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities such as open ports insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware In order for these tools to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release Typically these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently Beyond vulnerability scanning many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular penetration tests against their systems to identify vulnerabilities In some sectors this is a contractual requirement Reducing vulnerabilities The act of assessing and reducing vulnerabilities to cyber attacks is commonly referred to as information technology security assessments They aims to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities While formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible it is not yet common Operating systems formally verified include seL4 and SYSGOs PikeOS but these make up a very small percentage of the market It is possible to reduce an attackers chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates andor hiring people with expertise in security Large companies with significant threats can hire Security Operations Centre SOC Analysts These are specialists in cyber defences with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating reports of any new issues and preparing and testing disaster recovery plansWhilst no measures can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measures can help mitigate the damage of possible attacks The effects of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance Outside of formal assessments there are various methods of reducing vulnerabilities Two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information It requires something you know a password or PIN and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access Protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attacks can only be occur by noncomputer means which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving peoples knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing peoples awareness of threats However even in highly disciplined environments eg military organizations social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent Inoculation derived from inoculation theory seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts Hardware protection mechanisms Hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to softwareonly computer security Using devices and methods such as dongles trusted platform modules intrusionaware cases drive locks disabling USB ports and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised Each of these is covered in more detail below USB dongles are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other devices software The dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such as Advanced Encryption Standard AES provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing webbased content such as cloud software or Virtual Private Networks VPNs In addition a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer Trusted platform modules TPMs secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices through the use of microprocessors or socalled computersonachip TPMs used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices preventing unauthorized network and data access Computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives making them inaccessible to thieves Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices like camera GPS removable storage etc that are not in use Mobileenabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones Builtin capabilities such as Bluetooth the newer Bluetooth low energy LE nearfield communication NFC on noniOS devices and biometric validation such as thumbprint readers as well as QR code reader software designed for mobile devices offer new secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings IOMMUs allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of components in mobile and desktop computers by utilizing direct memory access protections Physical Unclonable Functions PUFs can be used as a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuits and hardware providing users the ability to secure the hardware supply chains going into their systems Secure operating systems One use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems Using secure operating systems is a good way of ensuring computer security These are systems that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluations are Common Criteria CC Secure coding In software engineering secure coding aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure Such systems are secure by design Beyond this formal verification aims to prove the correctness of the algorithms underlying a system important for cryptographic protocols for example Capabilities and access control lists Within computer systems two of the main security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists ACLs and rolebased access control RBAC An accesscontrol list ACL with respect to a computer file system is a list of permissions associated with an object An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects as well as what operations are allowed on given objects Rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees and can implement mandatory access control MAC or discretionary access control DAC A further approach capabilitybased security has been mostly restricted to research operating systems Capabilities can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design An opensource project in the area is the E language User security training The enduser is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than 90 of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management sending emails containing sensitive data and attachments to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments A common mistake that users make is saving their user idpassword in their browsers to make it easier to log in to banking sites This is a gift to attackers who have obtained access to a machine by some means The risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authenticationAs the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all levels not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats The focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks Digital hygiene Related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and as the analogy with personal hygiene shows is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimize the risks from cyber threats The assumption is that good cyber hygiene practices can give networked users another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attacks or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks Cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military termThe most common acts of digitalcyber hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backups passwords and ensuring restricted admin rights and network firewalls As opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threats cyber hygiene mostly regards routine measures that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education It can be thought of as an abstract list of tips or measures that have been demonstrated as having a positive effect on personal andor collective digital security As such these measures can be performed by laypeople not just security experts Cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene as computer viruses relate to biological viruses or pathogens However while the term computer virus was coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer viruses the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps as late as 2000 by Internet pioneer Vint Cerf It has since been adopted by the Congress and Senate of the United States the FBI EU institutions and heads of state Difficulty of responding to breaches Responding to attempted security breaches is often very difficult for a variety of reasons including Identifying attackers is difficult as they may operate through proxies temporary anonymous dialup accounts wireless connections and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction If they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete logs to cover their tracks The sheer number of attempted attacks often by automated vulnerability scanners and computer worms is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each Law enforcement officers often lack the skills interest or budget to pursue attackers In addition the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries which may be difficult or timeconsuming to obtainWhere an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdictions now have in place mandatory security breach notification laws Types of security and privacy Systems at risk The growth in the number of computer systems and the increasing reliance upon them by individuals businesses industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk Financial systems The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the US Securities and Exchange Commission SWIFT investment banks and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers brokerage accounts and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchases or selling the information on the black market Instore payment systems and ATMs have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and PINs The UCLA Internet Report Surveying the Digital Future 2000 found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users were somewhat or very concerned about credit card securityThe most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named SSL Secure Sockets Layer and its successor TLS Transport Layer Security identity management and authentication services and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce Several versions of SSL and TLS are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and VoIP voiceoverIP There are various interoperable implementations of these technologies including at least one implementation that is open source Open source allows anyone to view the applications source code and look for and report vulnerabilities The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard cooperated to develop the secure EMV chip which is embedded in credit cards Further developments include the Chip Authentication Program where banks give customers handheld card readers to perform online secure transactions Other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as Instant Issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue onthespot credit cards to interested customers Utilities and industrial equipment Computers control functions at many utilities including coordination of telecommunications the power grid nuclear power plants and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable In 2014 the Computer Emergency Readiness Team a division of the Department of Homeland Security investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies Aviation The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore There is also potential for attack from within an aircraftIn Europe with the PanEuropean Network Service and NewPENS and in the US with the NextGen program air navigation service providers are moving to create their own dedicated networks Many modern passports are now biometric passports containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name gender and date of birth In addition more countries are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud The introduction of the ePassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing Plans are under way in the US the UK and Australia to introduce SmartGate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology The airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets etickets These have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines Longdistance bus companies are also switching over to eticketing transactions today The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outages loss of aircraft and even loss of life Consumer devices Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target Smartphones tablet computers smart watches and other mobile devices such as quantified self devices like activity trackers have sensors such as cameras microphones GPS receivers compasses and accelerometers which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information WiFi Bluetooth and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breachThe increasing number of home automation devices such as the Nest thermostat are also potential targets Healthcare Today many healthcare providers and health insurance companies use the internet to provide enhanced products and services for example through use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness trackers to lower insurance premiums The health care company Humana partners with WebMD Oracle Corporation EDS and Microsoft to enable its members to access their health care records as well as to provide an overview of health care plans Patient records are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse networks alleviating the need for extra storage space Large corporations Large corporations are common targets In many cases attacks are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breaches Examples include the loss of millions of clients credit card and financial details by Home Depot Staples Target Corporation and EquifaxMedical records have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patients to obtain prescription drugs for recreational purposes or resale Although cyber threats continue to increase 62 of all organizations did not increase security training for their business in 2015Not all attacks are financially motivated however security firm HBGary Federal had a serious series of attacks in 2011 from hacktivist group Anonymous in retaliation for the firms CEO claiming to have infiltrated their group and Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014 with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leaks and crippling the company by wiping workstations and servers Automobiles Vehicles are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brakes seat belt tensioners door locks airbags and advanced driverassistance systems on many models Additionally connected cars may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network Selfdriving cars are expected to be even more complex All of these systems carry some security risks and such issues have gained wide attentionSimple examples of risk include a malicious compact disc being used as an attack vector and the cars onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping However if access is gained to a cars internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized 2015 test hackers remotely carjacked a vehicle from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditchManufacturers are reacting in numerous ways with Tesla in 2016 pushing out some security fixes over the air into its cars computer systems In the area of autonomous vehicles in September 2016 the United States Department of Transportation announced some initial safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policiesAdditionally eDrivers licenses are being developed using the same technology For example Mexicos licensing authority ICV has used a smart card platform to issue the first eDrivers licenses to the city of Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Len Shipping Shipping companies have adopted RFID Radio Frequency Identification technology as an efficient digitally secure tracking device Unlike a barcode RFID can be read up to 20 feet away RFID is used by FedEx and UPS Government Government and military computer systems are commonly attacked by activists and foreign powers Local and regional government infrastructure such as traffic light controls police and intelligence agency communications personnel records as well as student recordsThe FBI CIA and Pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their buildings However the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world More and more companies are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology GEs ACUVision for example offers a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording Internet of things and physical vulnerabilities The Internet of things IoT is the network of physical objects such as devices vehicles and buildings that are embedded with electronics software sensors and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data Concerns have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenges involvedWhile the IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems it also provides opportunities for misuse In particular as the Internet of Things spreads widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat If a front doors lock is connected to the Internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone People could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by IoTenabled devices Thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent nonInternetconnected hotel door locksAn attack that targets physical infrastructure andor human lives is sometimes referred to as a cyberkinetic attack As IoT devices and appliances gain currency cyberkinetic attacks can become pervasive and significantly damaging Medical systems Medical devices have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerabilities demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted devices including pacemakers and insulin pumps There are many reports of hospitals and hospital organizations getting hacked including ransomware attacks Windows XP exploits viruses and data breaches of sensitive data stored on hospital servers On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internetconnected devices but no structure for enforcement Energy sector In distributed generation systems the risk of a cyber attack is real according to Daily Energy Insider An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources DER Authority within the city with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility Pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand The DC proposal however would allow thirdparty vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid Telecommunications Perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the SIM Subscriber Identity Module card a device that is embedded in most of the worlds cellular devices before any service can be obtained The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment The Smart Card Web Servers draft standard SCWS defines the interfaces to an HTTP server in a smart card Tests are being conducted to secure OTA overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone Combination SIMDVD devices are being developed through Smart Video Card technology which embeds a DVDcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular SIM card Other telecommunication developments involving digital security include mobile signatures which use the embedded SIM card to generate a legally binding electronic signature Cost and impact of security breaches Serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from 13 billion worms and viruses only to 226 billion for all forms of covert attacks The reliability of these estimates is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotalHowever reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions According to the classic GordonLoeb Model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach Attacker motivation As with physical security the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers Some are thrillseekers or vandals some are activists others are criminals looking for financial gain Statesponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as Markus Hess who hacked for the KGB as recounted by Clifford Stoll in The Cuckoos Egg Attackers motivations can vary for all types of attacks from pleasure to for political goals For example hacktivists may target a company a company or organisation that carries out activities they do not agree with This would be to create bad publicity for the company by having its website crash High capability hackers often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demands of their financial backers These attacks are more likely to attempt more serious attack An example of a more serious attack was the 2015 Ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of files and denialofservice attacks to carry out the full attackAdditionally recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas The growth of the internet mobile technologies and inexpensive computing devices have led to a rise in capabilities but also to the risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations All critical targeted environments are susceptible to compromise and this has led to a series of proactive studies on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivations by these types of actors Several stark differences exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actors seeking to attack based on an ideological preferenceA standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system and who might be motivated to breach it The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured A home personal computer bank and classified military network face very different threats even when the underlying technologies in use are similar Computer security incident management Computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business as usual Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities restore services and processes and minimize losses Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organizations response to a cyberattack Without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles processes and procedures during an escalation slowing the organizations response and resolution There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan Preparation Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises Detection and analysis Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident Containment eradication and recovery Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains Post incident activity Post mortem analysis of the incident its root cause and the organizations response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts Notable attacks and breaches Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below Robert Morris and the first computer worm In 1988 60000 computers were connected to the Internet and most were mainframes minicomputers and professional workstations On 2 November 1988 many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers the first internet computer worm The software was traced back to 23yearold Cornell University graduate student Robert Tappan Morris who said he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet Rome Laboratory In 1994 over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory the US Air Forces main command and research facility Using trojan horses hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Romes networking systems and remove traces of their activities The intruders were able to obtain classified files such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Goddard Space Flight Center WrightPatterson Air Force Base some Defense contractors and other private sector organizations by posing as a trusted Rome center user TJX customer credit card details In early 2007 American apparel and home goods company TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion and that the hackers had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transactions Stuxnet attack In 2010 the computer worm known as Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of Irans nuclear centrifuges It did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controllers PLCs in a targeted attack This is generally believed to have been launched by Israel and the United States to disrupt Irans nuclear program although neither has publicly admitted this Global surveillance disclosures In early 2013 documents provided by Edward Snowden were published by The Washington Post and The Guardian exposing the massive scale of NSA global surveillance There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a NIST standard for encryption This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between Googles data centers Target and Home Depot breaches A Ukrainian hacker known as Rescator broke into Target Corporation computers in 2013 stealing roughly 40 million credit cards and then Home Depot computers in 2014 stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers Warnings were delivered at both corporations but ignored physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting says Jim Walter director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing Office of Personnel Management data breach In April 2015 the Office of Personnel Management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately 215 million personnel records handled by the office The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States Data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers names dates and places of birth addresses and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers Ashley Madison breach In July 2015 a hacker group is known as The Impact Team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison created by Avid Life Media The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well After the breach The Impact Team dumped emails from the companys CEO to prove their point and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently When Avid Life Media did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed files one 97GB and the second 20GB After the second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned but the website remained to function Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack In June 2021 the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the US and led to shortages across the East Coast Legal issues and global regulation International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature There is no global base of common rules to judge and eventually punish cybercrimes and cybercriminals and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute Proving attribution for cybercrimes and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies Computer viruses switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operations like this So the Internet is as if someone had given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world The use of techniques such as dynamic DNS fast flux and bullet proof servers add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement Role of government The role of the government is to make regulations to force companies and organizations to protect their systems infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national powergridThe governments regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated For some cyberspace was seen as a virtual space that was to remain free of government intervention as can be seen in many of todays libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussionsMany government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem R Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco he believes that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation If the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through On the other hand executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently Daniel R McCarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political orderOn 22 May 2020 the UN Security Council held its second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenges to international peace According to UN SecretaryGeneral Antnio Guterres new technologies are too often used to violate rights International actions Many different teams and organizations exist including The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams FIRST is the global association of CSIRTs The USCERT ATT Apple Cisco McAfee Microsoft are all members of this international team The Council of Europe helps protect societies worldwide from the threat of cybercrime through the Convention on Cybercrime The purpose of the Messaging AntiAbuse Working Group MAAWG is to bring the messaging industry together to work collaboratively and to successfully address the various forms of messaging abuse such as spam viruses denialofservice attacks and other messaging exploitations France Telecom Facebook ATT Apple Cisco Sprint are some of the members of the MAAWG ENISA The European Network and Information Security Agency ENISA is an agency of the European Union with the objective to improve network and information security in the European Union Europe On 14 April 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR The GDPR which came into force on 25 May 2018 grants individuals within the European Union EU and the European Economic Area EEA the right to the protection of personal data The regulation requires that any entity that processes personal data incorporate data protection by design and by default It also requires that certain organizations appoint a Data Protection Officer DPO National actions Computer emergency response teams Most countries have their own computer emergency response team to protect network security Canada Since 2010 Canada has had a cybersecurity strategy This functions as a counterpart document to the National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure The strategy has three main pillars securing government systems securing vital private cyber systems and helping Canadians to be secure online There is also a Cyber Incident Management Framework to provide a coordinated response in the event of a cyber incidentThe Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre CCIRC is responsible for mitigating and responding to threats to Canadas critical infrastructure and cyber systems It provides support to mitigate cyber threats technical support to respond recover from targeted cyber attacks and provides online tools for members of Canadas critical infrastructure sectors It posts regular cybersecurity bulletins operates an online reporting tool where individuals and organizations can report a cyber incidentTo inform the general public on how to protect themselves online Public Safety Canada has partnered with STOPTHINKCONNECT a coalition of nonprofit private sector and government organizations and launched the Cyber Security Cooperation Program They also run the GetCyberSafe portal for Canadian citizens and Cyber Security Awareness Month during OctoberPublic Safety Canada aims to begin an evaluation of Canadas cybersecurity strategy in early 2015 Australia Australian federal government announced an 182 million investment to fortify the cybersecurity resilience of small and medium enterprises SMEs and enhance their capabilities in responding to cyber threats This financial backing is an integral component of the soontobeunveiled 20232030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy slated for release within the current week A substantial allocation of 72 million is earmarked for the establishment of a voluntary cyber health check program facilitating businesses in conducting a comprehensive and tailored selfassessment of their cybersecurity upskill This avantgarde health assessment serves as a diagnostic tool enabling enterprises to ascertain the robustness of Australias cyber security regulations Furthermore it affords them access to a repository of educational resources and materials fostering the acquisition of skills necessary for an elevated cybersecurity posture This groundbreaking initiative was jointly disclosed by Minister for Cyber Security Clare ONeil and Minister for Small Business Julie Collins America The United States has its first fully formed cyber plan in 15 years as a result of the release of this National Cyber plan In this policy the US says it will Protect the country by keeping networks systems functions and data safe Promote American wealth by building a strong digital economy and encouraging strong domestic innovation Peace and safety should be kept by making it easier for the US to stop people from using computer tools for bad things working with friends and partners to do this and Increase the United States impact around the world to support the main ideas behind an open safe reliable and compatible Internet The new US cyber strategy seeks to allay some of those concerns by promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace urging nations to adhere to a set of norms both through international law and voluntary standards It also calls for specific measures to harden US government networks from attacks like the June 2015 intrusion into the US Office of Personnel Management OPM which compromised the records of about 42 million current and former government employees And the strategy calls for the US to continue to name and shame bad cyber actors calling them out publicly for attacks when possible along with the use of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure India Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy framework by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology MeitY which aims to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyberattacks and safeguard information such as personal information of web users financial and banking information and sovereign data CERT In is the nodal agency which monitors the cyber threats in the country The post of National Cyber Security Coordinator has also been created in the Prime Ministers Office PMO The Indian Companies Act 2013 has also introduced cyber law and cybersecurity obligations on the part of Indian directors Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000 Update in 2013 South Korea Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013 when the government news media television stations and bank websites were compromised the national government committed to the training of 5000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017 The South Korean government blamed its northern counterpart for these attacks as well as incidents that occurred in 2009 2011 and 2012 but Pyongyang denies the accusations United States Legislation The 1986 18 USC 1030 the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the key legislation It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of protected computers as defined in 18 USC 1030e2 Although various other measures have been proposed none has succeeded In 2013 executive order 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was signed which prompted the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework In response to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14028 on May 12 2021 to increase software security standards for sales to the government tighten detection and security on existing systems improve information sharing and training establish a Cyber Safety Review Board and improve incident response Standardized government testing services The General Services Administration GSA has standardized the penetration test service as a prevetted support service to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities and stop adversaries before they impact US federal state and local governments These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services HACS Agencies The Department of Homeland Security has a dedicated division responsible for the response system risk management program and requirements for cybersecurity in the United States called the National Cyber Security Division The division is home to USCERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructureThe third priority of the FBI is to Protect the United States against cyberbased attacks and hightechnology crimes and they along with the National White Collar Crime Center NW3C and the Bureau of Justice Assistance BJA are part of the multiagency task force The Internet Crime Complaint Center also known as IC3In addition to its own specific duties the FBI participates alongside nonprofit organizations such as InfraGardThe Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS operates in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division The CCIPS is in charge of investigating computer crime and intellectual property crime and is specialized in the search and seizure of digital evidence in computers and networks In 2017 CCIPS published A Framework for a Vulnerability Disclosure Program for Online Systems to help organizations clearly describe authorized vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct thereby substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal violation of law under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030The United States Cyber Command also known as USCYBERCOM has the mission to direct synchronize and coordinate cyberspace planning and operations to defend and advance national interests in collaboration with domestic and international partners It has no role in the protection of civilian networksThe US Federal Communications Commissions role in cybersecurity is to strengthen the protection of critical communications infrastructure to assist in maintaining the reliability of networks during disasters to aid in swift recovery after and to ensure that first responders have access to effective communications servicesThe Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance for medical devices and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is concerned with automotive cybersecurity After being criticized by the Government Accountability Office and following successful attacks on airports and claimed attacks on airplanes the Federal Aviation Administration has devoted funding to securing systems on board the planes of private manufacturers and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System Concerns have also been raised about the future Next Generation Air Transportation SystemThe US Department of Defense DoD issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004 supplemented by DoD Directive 8140 requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology IT certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge skills and abilities KSA Andersson and Reimers 2019 report these certifications range from CompTIAs A and Security through the ICS2orgs CISSP etc Computer emergency readiness team Computer emergency response team is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents In the US two distinct organizations exist although they do work closely together USCERT part of the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security CERTCC created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and run by the Software Engineering Institute SEI US NRC 10 CFR 7354 Cybersecurity In the context of US nuclear power plants the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC outlines cybersecurity requirements under 10 CFR Part 73 specifically in 7354 This section mandates that licensees provide high assurance against cyber attacks for digital equipment and computers and communications systems related to safety security emergency preparedness and support systems Licensees must submit a cybersecurity plan establish a comprehensive cybersecurity program and implement defenseindepth strategies to protect against cyber threats The plan must also include incident response and recovery measures ie Contingency Plans Contingency Plans for Power Grid for cyber attacks Details can be found in 10 CFR 7354 Protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks NEI 0809 Cybersecurity Plan for Nuclear Power Plants The Nuclear Energy Institutes NEI 0809 document Security Plan for Nuclear Power Reactors outlines a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity in the nuclear power industry Drafted with input from the US NRC this guideline is instrumental in aiding licensees to comply with Title 10 Part 73 Section 7354 10 CFR 7354 of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR which mandates robust protection of digital computers and equipment and communications systems at nuclear power plants against cyber threats NEI 0809 provides a structured approach to cybersecurity encompassing aspects such as the creation of a cyber security plan implementation of technical and management security controls and integration of these plans into the overall physical protection programs eg Physical Security Programs and other general Nuclear Security Programs in place at nuclear facilities It emphasizes a defenseindepth strategy employing layered security measures to safeguard critical digital assets CDAs ie critical assets businesscritical assets safetycritical assets from cyber attacks thereby ensuring the safety and integrity of nuclear power operations Refer to NEI 0809 for more details Modern warfare There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare As Mark Clayton from The Christian Science Monitor wrote in a 2015 article titled The New Cyber Arms Race In the future wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities transportation communications and energy Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops the path of jet fighters the command and control of warships This has led to new terms such as cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism The United States Cyber Command was created in 2009 and many other countries have similar forces There are a few critical voices that question whether cybersecurity is as significant a threat as it is made out to be Careers Cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of IT concerned with reducing organizations risk of hack or data breaches According to research from the Enterprise Strategy Group 46 of organizations say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skills in 2016 up from 28 in 2015 Commercial government and nongovernmental organizations all employ cybersecurity professionals The fastest increases in demand for cybersecurity workers are in industries managing increasing volumes of consumer data such as finance health care and retail However the use of the term cybersecurity is more prevalent in government job descriptionsTypical cybersecurity job

option for information security professionals of all experience levels to keep studying is online security training including webcasts A wide range of certified courses are also availableIn the United Kingdom a nationwide set of cybersecurity forums known as the UK Cyber Security Forum were established supported by the Governments cybersecurity strategy in order to encourage startups and innovation and to address the skills gap identified by the UK Government In Singapore the Cyber Security Agency has issued a Singapore Operational Technology OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework OTCCF The framework defines emerging cybersecurity roles in Operational Technology The OTCCF was endorsed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority IMDA It outlines the different OT cybersecurity job positions as well as the technical skills and core competencies necessary It also depicts the many career paths available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunities Terminology The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below Access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems These systems can protect either the whole computer such as through an interactive login screen or individual services such as a FTP server There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users such as passwords identification cards smart cards and biometric systems Antivirus software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software malware Applications are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block users the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignments to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing as few as possible They are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patches or updates for them For example programs can be installed into an individual users account which limits the programs potential access as well as being a means control which users have specific exceptions to policy In Linux FreeBSD OpenBSD and other Unixlike operating systems there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other means of restricting the application to its own sandbox For example Linux provides namespaces and Cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resources Generalized security frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor help administrators control access Java and other languages which compile to Java byte code and run in the Java virtual machine can have their access to other applications controlled at the virtual machine level Some software can be run in software containers which can even provide their own set of system libraries limiting the softwares or anyone controlling it access to the servers versions of the libraries Authentication techniques can be used to ensure that communication endpoints are who they say they are Automated theorem proving and other verification tools can be used to enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications Backups are one or more copies kept of important computer files Typically multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copies will still exist Capability and access control list techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control Capabilities vs ACLs discusses their use Chain of trust techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the systems designers Confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person Cryptographic techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems reducing the probability that the data exchange between systems can be intercepted or modified Cyberwarfare is an Internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems Such attacks can for example disable official websites and networks disrupt or disable essential services steal or alter classified data and cripple financial systems Data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data recordEncryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible Symmetrickey ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys and publickey encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance Endpoint security software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops mobile devices and USB drives Firewalls serve as a gatekeeper system between networks allowing only traffic that matches defined rules They often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features They are nearuniversal between company local area networks and the Internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured A hacker is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network Honey pots are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques Intrusiondetection systems are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations A microkernel is an approach to operating system design which has only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers protocol stacks and file systems in the safer less privileged user space Pinging The standard ping application can be used to test if an IP address is in use If it is attackers may then try a port scan to detect which services are exposed A port scan is used to probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications A key logger is spyware that silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user types on the computers keyboard Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security Logic bombs is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific event Zero trust security means that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resources on the network History Since the Internets arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years the notion of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives Cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 60 years of technological change In the 1970s and 1980s computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of the Internet where with increased connectivity computer viruses and network intrusions began to take off After the spread of viruses in the 1990s the 2000s marked the institutionalization of organized attacks such as distributed denial of service This led to the formalization of cybersecurity as a professional disciplineThe April 1967 session organized by Willis Ware at the Spring Joint Computer Conference and the later publication of the Ware Report were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security Wares work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concernsA 1977 NIST publication introduced the CIA triad of confidentiality integrity and availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals While still relevant many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposedHowever in the 1970s and 1980s there were no grave computer threats because computers and the internet were still developing and security threats were easily identifiable More often threats came from malicious insiders who gained unauthorized access to sensitive documents and files Although malware and network breaches existed during the early years they did not use them for financial gain By the second half of the 1970s established computer firms like IBM started offering commercial access control systems and computer security software productsOne of the earliest examples of an attack on a computer network was the computer worm Creeper written by Bob Thomas at BBN which propagated through the ARPANET in 1971 The program was purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload A later program Reaper was created by Ray Tomlinson in 1972 and used to destroy CreeperBetween September 1986 and June 1987 a group of German hackers performed the first documented case of cyber espionage The group hacked into American defense contractors universities and military base networks and sold gathered information to the Soviet KGB The group was led by Markus Hess who was arrested on 29 June 1987 He was convicted of espionage along with two coconspirators on 15 Feb 1990 In 1988 one of the first computer worms called the Morris worm was distributed via the Internet It gained significant mainstream media attentionIn 1993 Netscape started developing the protocol SSL shortly after the National Center for Supercomputing Applications NCSA launched Mosaic 10 the first web browser in 1993 Netscape had SSL version 10 ready in 1994 but it was never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerabilities These weaknesses included replay attacks and a vulnerability that allowed hackers to alter unencrypted communications sent by users However in February 1995 Netscape launched Version 20The National Security Agency NSA is responsible for the protection of US information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence The agency analyzes commonly used software and system configurations to find security flaws which it can use for offensive purposes against competitors of the United StatesNSA contractors created and sold clickandshoot attack tools to US agencies and close allies but eventually the tools made their way to foreign adversaries In 2016 NSAs own hacking tools were hacked and they have been used by Russia and North Korea NSAs employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries anxious to compete in cyberwarfare In 2007 the United States and Israel began exploiting security flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in Iran to refine nuclear materials Iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability which it began using against the United States Notable scholars See also References Further reading Branch Jordan 24 September 2020 Whats in a Name Metaphors and Cybersecurity International Organization Cambridge University Press CUP

Malware Analysis,Malware analysis is the study or process of determining the functionality origin and potential impact of a given malware sample such as a virus worm trojan horse rootkit or backdoor Malware or malicious software is any computer software intended to harm the host operating system or to steal sensitive data from users organizations or companies Malware may include software that gathers user information without permission Use cases There are three typical use cases that drive the need for malware analysis Computer security incident management If an organization discovers or suspects that some malware may have gotten into its systems a response team may wish to perform malware analysis on any potential samples that are discovered during the investigation process to determine if they are malware and if so what impact that malware might have on the systems within the target organizations environment Malware research Academic or industry malware researchers may perform malware analysis simply to understand how malware behaves and the latest techniques used in its construction Indicator of compromise extraction Vendors of software products and solutions may perform bulk malware analysis in order to determine potential new indicators of compromise this information may then feed the security product or solution to help organizations better defend themselves against attack by malware Types The method by which malware analysis is performed typically falls under one of two types Static malware analysis Static or Code Analysis is usually performed by dissecting the different resources of the binary file without executing it and studying each component The binary file can also be disassembled or reverse engineered using a disassembler such as IDA or Ghidra The machine code can sometimes be translated into assembly code which can be read and understood by humans the malware analyst can then read the assembly as it is correlated with specific functions and actions inside the program then make sense of the assembly instructions and have a better visualization of what the program is doing and how it was originally designed Viewing the assembly allows the malware analystreverse engineer to get a better understanding of what is supposed to happen versus what is really happening and start to map out hidden actions or unintended functionality Some modern malware is authored using evasive techniques to defeat this type of analysis for example by embedding syntactic code errors that will confuse disassemblers but that will still function during actual execution Dynamic malware analysis Dynamic or Behavioral analysis is performed by observing the behavior of the malware while it is actually running on a host system This form of analysis is often performed in a sandbox environment to prevent the malware from actually infecting production systems many such sandboxes are virtual systems that can easily be rolled back to a clean state after the analysis is complete The malware may also be debugged while running using a debugger such as GDB or WinDbg to watch the behavior and effects on the host system of the malware step by step while its instructions are being processed Modern malware can exhibit a wide variety of evasive techniques designed to defeat dynamic analysis including testing for virtual environments or active debuggers delaying execution of malicious payloads or requiring some form of interactive user input Stages Examining malicious software involves several stages including but not limited to the following Manual Code Reversing Interactive Behavior Analysis Static Properties Analysis FullyAutomated Analysis References,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware_analysis,Short,270,566
Intrusion Detection System,An intrusion detection system IDS also intrusion prevention system or IPS is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management SIEM system A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarmsIDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems NIDS and hostbased intrusion detection systems HIDS A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach The most wellknown variants are signaturebased detection recognizing bad patterns such as malware and anomalybased detection detecting deviations from a model of good traffic which often relies on machine learning Another common variant is reputationbased detection recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools such as using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic Comparison with firewalls Although they both relate to network security an IDS differs from a firewall in that a traditional network firewall distinct from a NextGeneration Firewall uses a static set of rules to permit or deny network connections It implicitly prevents intrusions assuming an appropriate set of rules have been defined Essentially firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications identifying heuristics and patterns often known as signatures of common computer attacks and taking action to alert operators A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system and performs access control like an application layer firewall Intrusion detection category IDS can be classified by where detection takes place network or host or the detection method that is employed signature or anomalybased Analyzed activity Network intrusion detection systems Network intrusion detection systems NIDS are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire subnet and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks Once an attack is identified or abnormal behavior is sensed the alert can be sent to the administrator An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network OPNET and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS When we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property there are two types online and offline NIDS often referred to as inline and tap mode respectively Online NIDS deals with the network in real time It analyses the Ethernet packets and applies some rules to decide if it is an attack or not Offline NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not NIDS can be also combined with other technologies to increase detection and prediction rates Artificial Neural Network based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data in a smart way due to the selforganizing structure that allows INS IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes INN IDS help develop an early warning system based on two layers The first layer accepts single values while the second layer takes the firsts layers output as input the cycle repeats and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen patterns in the network This system can average 999 detection and classification rate based on research results of 24 network attacks divided in four categories DOS Probe RemotetoLocal and usertoroot Host intrusion detection systems Host intrusion detection systems HIDS run on individual hosts or devices on the network A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot If the critical system files were modified or deleted an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines which are not expected to change their configurations Detection method Signaturebased Signaturebased IDS is the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns such as byte sequences in network traffic or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware This terminology originates from antivirus software which refers to these detected patterns as signatures Although signaturebased IDS can easily detect known attacks it is difficult to detect new attacks for which no pattern is available In signaturebased IDS the signatures are released by a vendor for all its products Ontime updating of the IDS with the signature is a key aspect Anomalybased Anomalybased intrusion detection systems were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks in part due to the rapid development of malware The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity and then compare new behavior against this model Since these models can be trained according to the applications and hardware configurations machine learning based method has a better generalized property in comparison to traditional signaturebased IDS Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks it may suffer from false positives previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the timeconsuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs Efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliableNew types of what could be called anomalybased intrusion detection systems are being viewed by Gartner as User and Entity Behavior Analytics UEBA an evolution of the user behavior analytics category and network traffic analysis NTA In particular NTA deals with malicious insiders as well as targeted external attacks that have compromised a user machine or account Gartner has noted that some organizations have opted for NTA over more traditional IDS Intrusion prevention Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system Intrusion detection and prevention systems IDPS are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents logging information about them and reporting attempts In addition organizations use IDPS for other purposes such as identifying problems with security policies documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organizationIDPS typically record information related to observed events notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding They use several response techniques which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself changing the security environment eg reconfiguring a firewall or changing the attacks contentIntrusion prevention systems IPS also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems IDPS are network security appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity log information about this activity report it and attempt to block or stop it Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic andor system activities for malicious activity The main differences are unlike intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems are placed inline and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected 273 289 IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm dropping detected malicious packets resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address An IPS also can correct cyclic redundancy check CRC errors defragment packet streams mitigate TCP sequencing issues and clean up unwanted transport and network layer options 278 Classification Intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types Networkbased intrusion prevention system NIPS monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity Wireless intrusion prevention system WIPS monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols Network behavior analysis NBA examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows such as distributed denial of service DDoS attacks certain forms of malware and policy violations Hostbased intrusion prevention system HIPS an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host Detection methods The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods signaturebased statistical anomalybased and stateful protocol analysis 301 Signaturebased detection Signaturebased IDS monitors packets in the Network and compares with preconfigured and predetermined attack patterns known as signatures Statistical anomalybased detection An IDS which is anomalybased will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline The baseline will identify what is normal for that network what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used It may however raise a False Positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured Ensemble models that use Matthews correlation coefficient to identify unauthorized network traffic have obtained 9973 accuracy Stateful protocol analysis detection This method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with predetermined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity Placement The correct placement of intrusion detection systems is critical and varies depending on the network The most common placement is behind the firewall on the edge of a network This practice provides the IDS with high visibility of traffic entering your network and will not receive any traffic between users on the network The edge of the network is the point in which a network connects to the extranet Another practice that can be accomplished if more resources are available is a strategy where a technician will place their first IDS at the point of highest visibility and depending on resource availability will place another at the next highest point continuing that process until all points of the network are coveredIf an IDS is placed beyond a networks firewall its main purpose would be to defend against noise from the internet but more importantly defend against common attacks such as port scans and network mapper An IDS in this position would monitor layers 4 through 7 of the OSI model and would be signaturebased This is a very useful practice because rather than showing actual breaches into the network that made it through the firewall attempted breaches will be shown which reduces the amount of false positives The IDS in this position also assists in decreasing the amount of time it takes to discover successful attacks against a networkSometimes an IDS with more advanced features will be integrated with a firewall in order to be able to intercept sophisticated attacks entering the network Examples of advanced features would include multiple security contexts in the routing level and bridging mode All of this in turn potentially reduces cost and operational complexityAnother option for IDS placement is within the actual network These will reveal attacks or suspicious activity within the network Ignoring the security within a network can cause many problems it will either allow users to bring about security risks or allow an attacker who has already broken into the network to roam around freely Intense intranet security makes it difficult for even those hackers within the network to maneuver around and escalate their privileges Limitations Noise can severely limit an intrusion detection systems effectiveness Bad packets generated from software bugs corrupt DNS data and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high falsealarm rate It is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the number of falsealarms Number of real attacks is often so far below the number of falsealarms that the real attacks are often missed and ignored Many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated A constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats Outdated signature databases can leave the IDS vulnerable to newer strategies For signaturebased IDS there will be lag between a new threat discovery and its signature being applied to the IDS During this lag time the IDS will be unable to identify the threat It cannot compensate for weak identification and authentication mechanisms or for weaknesses in network protocols When an attacker gains access due to weak authentication mechanisms then IDS cannot prevent the adversary from any malpractice Encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices Therefore the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusions have occurred Intrusion detection software provides information based on the network address that is associated with the IP packet that is sent into the network This is beneficial if the network address contained in the IP packet is accurate However the address that is contained in the IP packet could be faked or scrambled Due to the nature of NIDS systems and the need for them to analyse protocols as they are captured NIDS systems can be susceptible to the same protocolbased attacks to which network hosts may be vulnerable Invalid data and TCPIP stack attacks may cause a NIDS to crash The security measures on cloud computing do not consider the variation of users privacy needs They provide the same security mechanism for all users no matter if users are companies or an individual person Evasion techniques There are a number of techniques which attackers are using the following are considered simple measures which can be taken to evade IDS Fragmentation by sending fragmented packets the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the detection systems ability to detect the attack signature Avoiding defaults The TCP port utilised by a protocol does not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported For example an IDS may expect to detect a trojan on port 12345 If an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port the IDS may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan Coordinated lowbandwidth attacks coordinating a scan among numerous attackers or agents and allocating different ports or hosts to different attackers makes it difficult for the IDS to correlate the captured packets and deduce that a network scan is in progress Address spoofingproxying attackers can increase the difficulty of the Security Administrators ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy servers to bounce an attack If the source is spoofed and bounced by a server it makes it very difficult for IDS to detect the origin of the attack Pattern change evasion IDS generally rely on pattern matching to detect an attack By changing the data used in the attack slightly it may be possible to evade detection For example an Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow and an IDS is able to detect the attack signature of 10 common attack tools By modifying the payload sent by the tool so that it does not resemble the data that the IDS expects it may be possible to evade detection Development The earliest preliminary IDS concept was delineated in 1980 by James Anderson at the National Security Agency and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails User access logs file access logs and system event logs are examples of audit trails Fred Cohen noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usageDorothy E Denning assisted by Peter G Neumann published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today Her model used statistics for anomaly detection and resulted in an early IDS at SRI International named the Intrusion Detection Expert System IDES which ran on Sun workstations and could consider both user and network level data IDES had a dual approach with a rulebased Expert System to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users host systems and target systems The author of IDES An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders Teresa F Lunt proposed adding an artificial neural network as a third component She said all three components could then report to a resolver SRI followed IDES in 1993 with the Nextgeneration Intrusion Detection Expert System NIDESThe Multics intrusion detection and alerting system MIDAS an expert system using PBEST and Lisp was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann Haystack was also developed in that year using statistics to reduce audit trailsIn 1986 the National Security Agency started an IDS research transfer program under Rebecca Bace Bace later published the seminal text on the subject Intrusion Detection in 2000Wisdom Sense WS was a statisticsbased anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory WS created rules based on statistical analysis and then used those rules for anomaly detection In 1990 the Timebased Inductive Machine TIM did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in Common Lisp on a VAX 3500 computer The Network Security Monitor NSM performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun350 workstation The Information Security Officers Assistant ISOA was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics a profile checker and an expert system ComputerWatch at ATT Bell Labs used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detectionThen in 1991 researchers at the University of California Davis created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System DIDS which was also an expert system The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter NADIR also in 1991 was a prototype IDS developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratorys Integrated Computing Network ICN and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt NADIR used a statisticsbased anomaly detector and an expert system The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced Bro in 1998 which used its own rule language for packet analysis from libpcap data Network Flight Recorder NFR in 1999 also used libpcapAPE was developed as a packet sniffer also using libpcap in November 1998 and was renamed Snort one month later Snort has since become the worlds largest used IDSIPS system with over 300000 active users It can monitor both local systems and remote capture points using the TZSP protocol The Audit Data Analysis and Mining ADAM IDS in 2001 used tcpdump to build profiles of rules for classifications In 2003 Yongguang Zhang and Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodesIn 2015 Viegas and his colleagues proposed an anomalybased intrusion detection engine aiming SystemonChip SoC for applications in Internet of Things IoT for instance The proposal applies machine learning for anomaly detection providing energyefficiency to a Decision Tree NaiveBayes and kNearest Neighbors classifiers implementation in an Atom CPU and its hardwarefriendly implementation in a FPGA In the literature this was the first work that implement each classifier equivalently in software and hardware and measures its energy consumption on both Additionally it was the first time that was measured the energy consumption for extracting each features used to make the network packet classification implemented in software and hardware See also

Privacy,Privacy UK US is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby express themselves selectively The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity There have been many different conceptions of privacy throughout history Most cultures recognize the right of an individual to withhold aspects of their personal lives from public record The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government corporations or individuals is part of many countries privacy laws and in some cases constitutions With the rise of technology the debate regarding privacy has expanded from a bodily sense to include a digital sense In most countries the right to digital privacy is considered an extension of the original right to privacy and many countries have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities There are multiple techniques to invade privacy which may be employed by corporations or governments for profit or political reasons Conversely in order to protect privacy people may employ encryption or anonymity measures Etymology The word privacy is derived from the Latin word privatus which means set apart from what is public personal and belonging to oneself and not to the state History Privacy has historical roots in ancient Greek philosophical discussions The most wellknown of these was Aristotles distinction between two spheres of life the public sphere of the polis associated with political life and the private sphere of the oikos associated with domestic life Privacy is valued along with other basic necessities of life in the Jewish deuterocanonical Book of SirachIn the United States more systematic treatises of privacy did not appear until the 1890s with the development of privacy law in America Technology As technology has advanced the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it In the case of some technologies such as the printing press or the Internet the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the 1890 article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis The Right to Privacy and that it was written mainly in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologiesIn 1948 1984 written by George Orwell was published A classic dystopian novel 1984 describes the life of Winston Smith in 1984 located in Oceania a totalitarian state The allcontrolling Party the party in power led by Big Brother is able to control power through mass surveillance and limited freedom of speech and thought George Orwell provides commentary on the negative effects of totalitarianism particularly on privacy and censorship Parallels have been drawn between 1984 and modern censorship and privacy a notable example being that large social media companies rather than the government are able to monitor a users data and decide what is allowed to be said online through their censorship policies ultimately for monetary purposesIn the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy Vance Packards The Naked Society was a popular book on privacy from that era and led US discourse on privacy at that time In addition Alan Westins Privacy and Freedom shifted the debate regarding privacy from a physical sense how the government controls a persons body ie Roe v Wade and other activities such as wiretapping and photography As important records became digitized Westin argued that personal data was becoming too accessible and that a person should have complete jurisdiction over their data laying the foundation for the modern discussion of privacyNew technologies can also create new ways to gather private information In 2001 the legal case Kyllo v United States 533 US 27 determined that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant constitutes a violation of privacy In 2019 after developing a corporate rivalry in competing voicerecognition software Apple and Amazon required employees to listen to intimate moments and faithfully transcribe the contents Police and government Police and citizens often conflict on what degree the police can intrude a citizens digital privacy For instance in 2012 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in United States v Jones 565 US 400 in the case of Antoine Jones who was arrested of drug possession using a GPS tracker on his car that was placed without a warrant that warrantless tracking infringes the Fourth Amendment The Supreme Court also justified that there is some reasonable expectation of privacy in transportation since the reasonable expectation of privacy had already been established under Griswold v Connecticut 1965 The Supreme Court also further clarified that the Fourth Amendment did not only pertain to physical instances of intrusion but also digital instances and thus United States v Jones became a landmark caseIn 2014 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Riley v California 573 US 373 where David Leon Riley was arrested after he was pulled over for driving on expired license tags when the police searched his phone and discovered that he was tied to a shooting that searching a citizens phone without a warrant was an unreasonable search a violation of the Fourth Amendment The Supreme Court concluded that the cell phones contained personal information different from trivial items and went beyond to state that information stored on the cloud was not necessarily a form of evidence Riley v California evidently became a landmark case protecting the digital protection of citizens privacy when confronted with the policeA recent notable occurrence of the conflict between law enforcement and a citizen in terms of digital privacy has been in the 2018 case Carpenter v United States 585 US In this case the FBI used cell phone records without a warrant to arrest Timothy Ivory Carpenter on multiple charges and the Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of cell phone records violated the Fourth Amendment citing that the Fourth Amendment protects reasonable expectations of privacy and that information sent to third parties still falls under data that can be included under reasonable expectations of privacyBeyond law enforcement many interactions between the government and citizens have been revealed either lawfully or unlawfully specifically through whistleblowers One notable example is Edward Snowden who released multiple operations related to the mass surveillance operations of the National Security Agency NSA where it was discovered that the NSA continues to breach the security of millions of people mainly through mass surveillance programs whether it was collecting great amounts of data through third party private companies hacking into other embassies or frameworks of international countries and various breaches of data which prompted a culture shock and stirred international debate related to digital privacy Internet The Internet and technologies built on it enable new forms of social interactions at increasingly faster speeds and larger scales Because the computer networks which underlie the Internet introduce such a wide range of novel security concerns the discussion of privacy on the Internet is often conflated with security Indeed many entities such as corporations involved in the surveillance economy inculcate a securityfocused conceptualization of privacy which reduces their obligations to uphold privacy into a matter of regulatory compliance while at the same time lobbying to minimize those regulatory requirementsHowever the Internets effect on privacy also includes all of the ways that computational technology and the entities which control it can subvert the privacy expectations of their users In particular the right to be forgotten is motivated by both the computational ability to store and search through massive amounts of data as well as the subverted expectations of users who share information online without expecting it to be stored and retained indefinitely Phenomena such as revenge porn and deepfakes require both the ability to obtain images without someones consent as well as the social infrastructure to disseminate that content widely Therefore privacy advocacy groups such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and the Electronic Frontier Foundation argue that addressing the new privacy harms introduced by the Internet requires both technological improvements to encryption and anonymity as well as societal efforts such as legal regulations to restrict corporate and government powerWhile the Internet began as a government and academic effort up through the 1980s private corporations began to enclose the hardware and software of the Internet in the 1990s and now most Internet infrastructure is owned and managed by forprofit corporations As a result the ability of governments to protect their citizens privacy is largely restricted to industrial policy instituting controls on corporations that handle communications or personal data Privacy regulations are often further constrained to only protect specific demographics such as children or specific industries such as credit card bureaus Social networking Several online social network sites OSNs are among the top 10 most visited websites globally Facebook for example as of August 2015 was the largest socialnetworking site with nearly 27 billion members who upload over 475 billion pieces of content daily While Twitter is significantly smaller with 316 million registered users the US Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring and permanently storing the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals privacy of online social networking show the following results first adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users second policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs third in the case of using OSNs and its services traditional onedimensional privacy approaches fall short This is exacerbated by deanonymization research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation race religious and political views personality or intelligence can be inferred based on a wide variety of digital footprints such as samples of text browsing logs or Facebook LikesIntrusions of social media privacy are known to affect employment in the United States Microsoft reports that 75 percent of US recruiters and humanresource professionals now do online research about candidates often using information provided by search engines socialnetworking sites photovideosharing sites personal web sites and blogs and Twitter They also report that 70 percent of US recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information This has created a need by many candidates to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations the conjunction of which has led to legal suits against both social media sites and US employers Selfie culture Selfies are popular today A search for photos with the hashtag selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and 51 million with the hashtag me However due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance this may pose a risk to privacy In a research study which takes a sample size of 3763 researchers found that for users posting selfies on social media women generally have greater concerns over privacy than men and that users privacy concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity Online harassment An invasion of someones privacy may be widely and quickly disseminated over the Internet When social media sites and other online communities fail to invest in content moderation an invasion of privacy can expose people to a much greater volume and degree of harassment than would otherwise be possible Revenge porn may lead to misogynist or homophobic harassment such as in the suicide of Amanda Todd and the suicide of Tyler Clementi When someones physical location or other sensitive information is leaked over the Internet via doxxing harassment may escalate to direct physical harm such as stalking or swatting Despite the way breaches of privacy can magnify online harassment online harassment is often used as a justification to curtail freedom of speech by removing the expectation of privacy via anonymity or by enabling law enforcement to invade privacy without a search warrant In the wake of Amanda Todds death the Canadian parliament proposed a motion purporting to stop bullying but Todds mother herself gave testimony to parliament rejecting the bill due to its provisions for warrantless breaches of privacy stating I dont want to see our children victimized again by losing privacy rightsEven where these laws have been passed despite privacy concerns they have not demonstrated a reduction in online harassment When the Korea Communications Commission introduced a registration system for online commenters in 2007 they reported that malicious comments only decreased by 09 and in 2011 it was repealed A subsequent analysis found that the set of users who posted the most comments actually increased the number of aggressive expressions when forced to use their real nameIn the US while federal law only prohibits online harassment based on protected characteristics such as gender and race individual states have expanded the definition of harassment to further curtail speech Floridas definition of online harassment includes any use of data or computer software that Has the effect of substantially disrupting the orderly operation of a school Privacy and locationbased services Increasingly mobile devices facilitate location tracking This creates user privacy problems A users location and preferences constitute personal information and their improper use violates that users privacy A recent MIT study by de Montjoye et al showed that four spatiotemporal points constituting approximate places and times are enough to uniquely identify 95 of 15M people in a mobility database The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low Therefore even coarse or blurred datasets confer little privacy protectionSeveral methods to protect user privacy in locationbased services have been proposed including the use of anonymizing servers and blurring of information Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of obtaining accurate location information and the risks of breaching an individuals privacy Ethical controversies over location privacy There have been scandals regarding location privacy One instance was the scandal concerning AccuWeather where it was revealed that AccuWeather was selling locational data This consisted of a users locational data even if they opted out within Accuweather which tracked users location Accuweather sold this data to Reveal Mobile a company that monetizes data related to a users location Other international cases are similar to the Accuweather case In 2017 a leaky API inside the McDelivery App exposed private data which consisted of home addresses of 22 million usersIn the wake of these types of scandals many large American technology companies such as Google Apple and Facebook have been subjected to hearings and pressure under the US legislative system In 2011 US Senator Al Franken wrote an open letter to Steve Jobs noting the ability of iPhones and iPads to record and store users locations in unencrypted files Apple claimed this was an unintentional software bug but Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology directly challenged that portrayal stating Im glad that they are fixing what they call bugs but I take exception with their strong denial that they track users In 2021 the US state of Arizona found in a court case that Google misled its users and stored the location of users regardless of their location settings Advertising The Internet has become a significant medium for advertising with digital marketing making up approximately half of the global ad spending in 2019 While websites are still able to sell advertising space without tracking including via contextual advertising digital ad brokers such as Facebook and Google have instead encouraged the practice of behavioral advertising providing code snippets used by website owners to track their users via HTTP cookies This tracking data is also sold to other third parties as part of the mass surveillance industry Since the introduction of mobile phones data brokers have also been planted within apps resulting in a 350 billion digital industry especially focused on mobile devicesDigital privacy has become the main source of concern for many mobile users especially with the rise of privacy scandals such as the FacebookCambridge Analytica data scandal Recently Apple has received positive press for features that prohibit advertisers from tracking a users data without their consent While Google attempted to introduce an alternative to cookies named FLoC which it claimed reduced the privacy harms it later retracted the proposal due to antitrust probes and analyses that contradicted their claims of privacy Metadata The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade Importantly directly observed behavior such as browsing logs search queries or contents of a public Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual such as sexual orientation political and religious views race substance use intelligence and personality In Australia the Telecommunications Interception and Access Amendment Data Retention Act 2015 made a distinction between collecting the contents of messages sent between users and the metadata surrounding those messages Legal right to privacy Most countries give citizens rights to privacy in their constitutions Representative examples of this include the Constitution of Brazil which says the privacy private life honor and image of people are inviolable the Constitution of South Africa says that everyone has a right to privacy and the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed The Italian Constitution also defines the right to privacy Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions including Australias Privacy Act 1988 Argentinas Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000 Canadas 2000 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and Japans 2003 Personal Information Protection LawBeyond national privacy laws there are international privacy agreements The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights says No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy family home or correspondence nor to attacks upon their honor and reputation The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980 The European Unions 1995 Data Protection Directive guides privacy protection in Europe The 2004 Privacy Framework by the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization Free market vs consumer protection Approaches to privacy can broadly be divided into two categories free market or consumer protectionOne example of the free market approach is to be found in the voluntary OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data The principles reflected in the guidelines free of legislative interference are analyzed in an article putting them into perspective with concepts of the GDPR put into law later in the European UnionIn a consumer protection approach in contrast it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices or may not have reasonable alternatives available In support of this view Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person By country Australia The Privacy Act 1988 is administered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector specifically to Federal government departments under the Information Privacy Principles State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers under Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking legal and patient doctor relationshipsIn 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission ALRC conducted a review of Australian privacy law and produced a report titled For Your Information Recommendations were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the Privacy Amendment Enhancing Privacy Protection Bill 2012 In 2015 the Telecommunications Interception and Access Amendment Data Retention Act 2015 was passed to some controversy over its human rights implications and the role of media European Union In 2016 the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which was intended to reduce the misuse of personal data and enhance individual privacy by requiring companies to receive consent before acquiring personal information from usersAlthough there are comprehensive regulations for data protection in the European Union one study finds that despite the laws there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws The European Union also champions the Right to be Forgotten concept in support of its adoption by other countries India Since the introduction of the Aadhaar project in 2009 which resulted in all 12 billion Indians being associated with a 12digit biometricsecured number Aadhaar has uplifted the poor in India by providing them with a form of identity and preventing the fraud and waste of resources as normally the government would not be able to allocate its resources to its intended assignees due to the ID issues With the rise of Aadhaar India has debated whether Aadhaar violates an individuals privacy and whether any organization should have access to an individuals digital profile as the Aadhaar card became associated with other economic sectors allowing for the tracking of individuals by both public and private bodies Aadhaar databases have suffered from security attacks as well and the project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures In 2017 where the Aadhar was challenged the Indian Supreme Court declared privacy as a human right but postponed the decision regarding the constitutionality of Aadhaar for another bench In September 2018 the Indian Supreme Court determined that the Aadhaar project did not violate the legal right to privacy United Kingdom In the United Kingdom it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy An action may be brought under another tort usually breach of confidence and privacy must then be considered under EC law In the UK it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest There is however the Information Commissioners Office ICO an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information They do this by promoting good practice ruling on eligible complaints giving information to individuals and organisations and taking action when the law is broken The relevant UK laws include Data Protection Act 1998 Freedom of Information Act 2000 Environmental Information Regulations 2004 Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 The ICO has also provided a Personal Information Toolkit online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online United States Although the US Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy individual as well as locational privacy may be implicitly granted by the Constitution under the 4th Amendment The Supreme Court of the United States has found that other guarantees have penumbras that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion for example in Griswold v Connecticut and Roe v Wade Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization later overruled Roe v Wade with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas characterizing Griswolds penumbral argument as having a facial absurdity casting doubt on the validity of a constitutional right to privacy in the United States and of previous decisions relying on it In the United States the right of freedom of speech granted in the First Amendment has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy Privacy is regulated in the US by the Privacy Act of 1974 and various state laws The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to federal agencies in the executive branch of the federal government Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA the GrammLeachBliley Act GLB and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA Unlike the EU and most EUmember states the US does not recognize the right to privacy of nonUS citizens The UNs Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy Joseph A Cannataci criticized this distinction Conceptions of privacy Privacy as contextual integrity The theory of contextual integrity developed by Helen Nissenbaum defines privacy as an appropriate information flow where appropriateness in turn is defined as conformance with legitimate informational norms specific to social contexts Right to be let alone In 1890 the United States jurists Samuel D Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote The Right to Privacy an article in which they argued for the right to be let alone using that phrase as a definition of privacy This concept relies on the theory of natural rights and focuses on protecting individuals The citation was a response to recent technological developments such as photography and sensationalist journalism also known as yellow journalismThere is extensive commentary over the meaning of being let alone and among other ways it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings such as ones own home Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights in the US Limited access Limited access refers to a persons ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about themVarious theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to ones personal information Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late 19th century that nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life or in other words the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison Nine years earlier Sissela Bok said that privacy is the condition of being protected from unwanted access by otherseither physical access personal information or attention Control over information Control over ones personal information is the concept that privacy is the claim of individuals groups or institutions to determine for themselves when how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others Generally a person who has consensually formed an interpersonal relationship with another person is not considered protected by privacy rights with respect to the person they are in the relationship with Charles Fried said that Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves Nevertheless in the era of big data control over information is under pressure States of privacy Alan Westin defined four statesor experiencesof privacy solitude intimacy anonymity and reserve Solitude is a physical separation from others Intimacy is a close relaxed and frank relationship between two or more individuals that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals Anonymity is the desire of individuals for times of public privacy Lastly reserve is the creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individuals need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning themselfIn addition to the psychological barrier of reserve Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers physical behavioral and normative Physical barriers such as walls and doors prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual In this sense accessing an individual includes accessing personal information about them Behavioral barriers communicate to othersverbally through language or nonverbally through personal space body language or clothingthat an individual does not want the other person to access or experience them Lastly normative barriers such as laws and social norms restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual Secrecy Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantageIn various legal contexts when privacy is described as secrecy a conclusion is reached if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed When privacyassecrecy is discussed it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private Personhood and autonomy Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of ones ownership of their physical and mental reality and a moral right to selfdetermination Through the social ritual of privacy or the social practice of respecting an individuals privacy barriers the social group communicates to developing children that they have exclusive moral rights to their bodiesin other words moral ownership of their body This entails control over both active physical and cognitive appropriation the former being control over ones movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience ones physical existence and whenAlternatively Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agencyas an individual with the capacity to choose Privacy is required to exercise choice Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a determinate character and limited probabilities Covert observation on the other hand changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consentIn addition privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy a concept closely connected to that of personhood According to Joseph Kufer an autonomous selfconcept entails a conception of oneself as a purposeful selfdetermining responsible agent and an awareness of ones capacity to control the boundary between self and otherthat is to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent Furthermore others must acknowledge and respect the selfs boundariesin other words they must respect the individuals privacyThe studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent they develop an autonomous selfconcept In addition studies of adults in particular institutions such as Erving Goffmans study of total institutions such as prisons and mental institutions suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate ones sense of autonomy over time Selfidentity and personal growth Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of selfidentity Privacy barriers in particular are instrumental in this process According to Irwin Altman such barriers define and limit the boundaries of the self and thus serve to help define the self This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others Control over the permeability of the selfs boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the selfIn addition privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth a process integral to the development of selfidentity Hyman Gross suggested that without privacysolitude anonymity and temporary releases from social rolesindividuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in selfdiscovery and selfcriticism Such selfdiscovery and selfcriticism contributes to ones understanding of oneself and shapes ones sense of identity Intimacy In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or intimate relationships with other humans Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to selfdisclose most if not all personal information this is one area in which privacy does not applyJames Rachels advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people Protecting intimacy is at the core of the concept of sexual privacy which law professor Danielle Citron argues should be protected as a unique form of privacy Physical privacy Physical privacy could be defined as preventing intrusions into ones physical space or solitude An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the US Fourth Amendment which guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizuresPhysical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity personal dignity andor shyness There may also be concerns about safety if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking There are different things that can be prevented to protect ones physical privacy including people watching even through recorded images ones intimate behaviours or body parts and unhautorized access to ones personal possessions or places Examples of possible efforts used to avoid the former especially for modesty reasons are clothes walls fences privacy screens cathedral glass window coverings etc Organizational Government agencies corporations groupssocieties and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals adopting various security practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets For example a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege or declare certain information to be classified or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets Privacy selfsynchronization Privacy selfsynchronization is a hypothesized mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the programs maximum success The stakeholders may be customers employees managers executives suppliers partners or investors When selfsynchronization is reached the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals An individual right David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy He develops data protection as an aspect of privacy which involves the collection use and dissemination of personal information This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control individuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is usedRichard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information which reduces market efficiency For Posner employment is selling oneself in the labour market which he believes is like selling a product Any defect in the product that is not reported is fraud For Lessig privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law Lessig claims the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right and that individuals should be able to control information about themselves A collective value and a human right There have been attempts to establish privacy as one of the fundamental human rights whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societiesPriscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions shared perceptions public values and collective components Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought Public values guarantee democratic participation including freedoms of speech and association and limits government power Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided Regans goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making if we did recognize the collective or publicgood value of privacy as well as the common and public value of privacy those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protectionLeslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation and ensures human dignity and autonomy Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed and if this is appropriate Violations of privacy depend on context The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a peoplecentered perspective and not through the marketplaceDr Eliza Watt Westminster Law School University of Westminster in London UK proposes application of the International Human Right Law IHRL concept of virtual control as an approach to deal with extraterritorial mass surveillance by state intelligence agencies Dr Watt envisions the virtual control test understood as a remote control over the individuals right to privacy of communications where privacy is recognized under the ICCPR Article 17 This she contends may help to close the normative gap that is being exploited by nation states Privacy paradox and economic valuation The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not While this term was coined as early as 1998 it was not used in its current popular sense until the year 2000Susan B Barnes similarly used the term privacy paradox to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media When compared to adults young people tend to disclose more information on social media However this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy Susan B Barnes gave a case in her article in a television interview about Facebook a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online However when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page she put her home address phone numbers and pictures of her young son on the page The privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings Several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users However by now an increasing number of studies have also shown that there are significant and at times large correlations between privacy concerns and information sharing behavior which speaks against the privacy paradox A metaanalysis of 166 studies published on the topic reported an overall small but significant relation between privacy concerns and informations sharing or use of privacy protection measures So although there are several individual instances or anecdotes where behavior appear paradoxical on average privacy concerns and privacy behaviors seem to be related and several findings question the general existence of the privacy paradoxHowever the relationship between concerns and behavior is likely only small and there are several arguments that can explain why that is the case According to the attitudebehavior gap attitudes and behaviors are in general and in most cases not closely related A main explanation for the partial mismatch in the context of privacy specifically is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online On the other hand some researchers argue that the mismatch comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites For example users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy Psychologists Sonja Utz and Nicole C Krmer particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox can occur when users must tradeoff between their privacy concerns and impression management Research on irrational decision making A study conducted by Susanne Barth and Menno DT de Jo demonstrates that decision making takes place on an irrational level especially when it comes to mobile computing Mobile applications in particular are often built up in such a way that spurs decision making that is fast and automatic without assessing risk factors Protection measures against these unconscious mechanisms are often difficult to access while downloading and installing apps Even with mechanisms in place to protect user privacy users may not have the knowledge or experience to enable these mechanismsUsers of mobile applications generally have very little knowledge of how their personal data are used When they decide which application to download they typically are not able to effectively interpret the information provided by application vendors regarding the collection and use of personal data Other research finds that this lack of interpretability means users are much more likely to be swayed by cost functionality design ratings reviews and number of downloads than requested permissions for usage of their personal data The economic valuation of privacy The willingness to incur a privacy risk is suspected to be driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes personal value for private information and general attitudes to privacy which are typically measured using surveys One experiment aiming to determine the monetary value of several types of personal information indicated relatively low evaluations of personal information Despite claims that ascertaining the value of data requires a stockmarket for personal information surveillance capitalism and the mass surveillance industry regularly place price tags on this form of data as it is shared between corporations and governments Information asymmetry Users are not always given the tools to live up to their professed privacy concerns and they are sometimes willing to trade private information for convenience functionality or financial gain even when the gains are very small One study suggests that people think their browser history is worth the equivalent of a cheap meal Another finds that attitudes to privacy risk do not appear to depend on whether it is already under threat or not The methodology of user empowerment describes how to provide users with sufficient context to make privacyinformed decisions Inherent necessity for privacy violation It is suggested by Andra Belliger and David J Krieger that the privacy paradox should not be considered a paradox but more of a privacy dilemma for services that cannot exist without the user sharing private data However the general public is typically not given the choice whether to share private data or not making it difficult to verify any claim that a service truly cannot exist without sharing private data Privacy calculus model The privacy calculus model posits that two factors determine privacy behavior namely privacy concerns or perceived risks and expected benefits By now the privacy calculus has been supported by several studies Actions which reduce privacy As with other conceptions of privacy there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove challenge lessen or attack privacy In 1960 legal scholar William Prosser created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection Intrusion into a persons private space own affairs or wish for solitude Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them Encroaching someones personality rights and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their ownFrom 2004 to 2008 building from this and other historical precedents Daniel J Solove presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy including collection of information which is already somewhat public processing of information sharing information and invading personal space to get private information Collecting information In the context of harming privacy information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it Examples include surveillance and interrogation Another example is how consumers and marketers also collect information in the business context through facial recognition which has recently caused a concern for things such as privacy There is currently research being done related to this topic Aggregating information It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed together in such a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following data aggregation which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information identification which can mean breaking the deidentification of items of data by putting it through a deanonymization process thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people insecurity such as lack of data security which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a data breach which harms the people whose data it held secondary use which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose but then the data is used in ways without the data donors informed consent exclusion is the use of a persons data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage Information dissemination Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the informationThere are various examples of this Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a persons information private then breaks that promise Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share such as revealing their private life experiences their nudity or perhaps private body functions Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it as in the case of doxxing Blackmail is making a threat to share information perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone Appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone and can include using the value of someones reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person Invasion Invasion of privacy a subset of expectation of privacy is a different concept from the collecting aggregating and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets An invasion is an attack in which information whether intended to be public or not is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken Intrusion An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a persons private personal space and solitude for any reason regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space Decisional interference is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decisionmaking process of another person perhaps to influence that persons private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has Examples of invasions of privacy In 2019 contract workers for Apple and Amazon reported being forced to continue listening to intimate moments captured on the companies smart speakers in order to improve the quality of their automated speech recognition software Techniques to improve privacy Similarly to actions which reduce privacy there are multiple angles of privacy and multiple techniques to improve them to varying extents When actions are done at an organizational level they may be referred to as cybersecurity Encryption Individuals can encrypt emails via enabling either two encryption protocols SMIME which is built into companies like Apple or Outlook and thus most common or PGP The Signal messaging app which encrypts messages so that only the recipient can read the message is notable for being available on many mobile devices and implementing a form of perfect forward secrecy Anonymity Anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like I2P and Tor can be used to prevent Internet service providers ISP from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates by hiding IP addresses and location but does not necessarily protect a user from third party data mining Anonymizing proxies are built into a users device in comparison to a Virtual Private Network VPN where users must download software Using a VPN hides all data and connections that are exchanged between servers and a users computer resulting in the online data of the user being unshared and secure providing a barrier between the user and their ISP and is especially important to use when a user is connected to public WiFi However users should understand that all their data does flow through the VPNs servers rather than the ISP Users should decide for themselves if they wish to use either an anonymizing proxy or a VPN In a more nontechnical sense using incognito mode or private browsing mode will prevent a users computer from saving history Internet files and cookies but the ISP will still have access to the users search history Using anonymous search engines will not share a users history clicks and will obstruct ad blockers User empowerment Concrete solutions on how to solve paradoxical behavior still do not exist Many efforts are focused on processes of decision making like restricting data access permissions during application installation but this would not completely bridge the gap between user intention and behavior Susanne Barth and Menno DT de Jong believe that for users to make more conscious decisions on privacy matters the design needs to be more useroriented Other security measures In a social sense simply limiting the amount of personal information that users posts on social media could increase their security which in turn makes it harder for criminals to perform identity theft Moreover creating a set of complex passwords and using twofactor authentication can allow users to be less susceptible to their accounts being compromised when various data leaks occur Furthermore users should protect their digital privacy by using antivirus software which can block harmful viruses like a popup scanning for personal information on a users computer Legal methods Although there are laws that promote the protection of users in some countries like the US there is no federal digital privacy law and privacy settings are essentially limited by the state of current enacted privacy laws To further their privacy users can start conversing with representatives letting representatives know that privacy is a main concern which in turn increases the likelihood of further privacy laws being enacted Privacy in nonhuman animals David Attenborough a biologist and natural historian affirmed that gorillas value their privacy while discussing a brief escape by a gorilla in London ZooAnimals in zoos have been found to exhibit harmful or different behaviours due to the presence of visitors watching them Cottontop tamarins in zoos engage in less social behaviours including physical contact and sex than ones in offexhibit buildings Chimpanzees become more aggressive towards each other Liontailed macaques pace and bite themselves more in direct proportions to human
