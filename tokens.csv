Cryptography,cryptographi or cryptolog from ancient greek roman krypt hidden secret and graphein to write or logia studi respect is the practic and studi of techniqu for secur commun in the presenc of adversari behavior more gener cryptographi is about construct and analyz protocol that prevent third parti or the public from read privat messag modern cryptographi exist at the intersect of the disciplin of mathemat comput scienc inform secur electr engin digit signal process physic and other core concept relat to inform secur data confidenti data integr authent and nonrepudi are also central to cryptographi practic applic of cryptographi includ electron commerc chipbas payment card digit currenc comput password and militari commun cryptographi prior to the modern age wa effect synonym with encrypt convert readabl inform plaintext to unintellig nonsens text ciphertext which can onli be read by revers the process decrypt the sender of an encrypt code messag share the decrypt decod techniqu onli with the intend recipi to preclud access from adversari the cryptographi literatur often use the name alic or a for the sender bob or b for the intend recipi and eve or e for the eavesdrop adversari sinc the develop of rotor cipher machin in world war i and the advent of comput in world war ii cryptographi method have becom increasingli complex and their applic more vari modern cryptographi is heavili base on mathemat theori and comput scienc practic cryptograph algorithm are design around comput hard assumpt make such algorithm hard to break in actual practic by ani adversari while it is theoret possibl to break into a welldesign system it is infeas in actual practic to do so such scheme if well design are therefor term comput secur theoret advanc eg improv in integ factor algorithm and faster comput technolog requir these design to be continu reevalu and if necessari adapt informationtheoret secur scheme that provabl can not be broken even with unlimit comput power such as the onetim pad are much more difficult to use in practic than the best theoret breakabl but comput secur scheme the growth of cryptograph technolog ha rais a number of legal issu in the inform age cryptographi potenti for use as a tool for espionag and sedit ha led mani govern to classifi it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit it use and export in some jurisdict where the use of cryptographi is legal law permit investig to compel the disclosur of encrypt key for document relev to an investig cryptographi also play a major role in digit right manag and copyright infring disput with regard to digit media terminolog the first use of the term cryptograph as oppos to cryptogram date back to the centuryorigin from the goldbug a stori by edgar allan poeuntil modern time cryptographi refer almost exclus to encrypt which is the process of convert ordinari inform call plaintext into an unintellig form call ciphertext decrypt is the revers in other word move from the unintellig ciphertext back to plaintext a cipher or cypher is a pair of algorithm that carri out the encrypt and the revers decrypt the detail oper of a cipher is control both by the algorithm and in each instanc by a key the key is a secret ideal known onli to the communic usual a string of charact ideal short so it can be rememb by the user which is need to decrypt the ciphertext in formal mathemat term a cryptosystem is the order list of element of finit possibl plaintext finit possibl cyphertext finit possibl key and the encrypt and decrypt algorithm that correspond to each key key are import both formal and in actual practic as cipher without variabl key can be trivial broken with onli the knowledg of the cipher use and are therefor useless or even counterproduct for most purpos histor cipher were often use directli for encrypt or decrypt without addit procedur such as authent or integr check there are two main type of cryptosystem symmetr and asymmetr in symmetr system the onli one known until the the same secret key encrypt and decrypt a messag data manipul in symmetr system is significantli faster than in asymmetr system asymmetr system use a public key to encrypt a messag and a relat privat key to decrypt it the advantag of asymmetr system is that the public key can be freeli publish allow parti to establish secur commun without have a share secret key in practic asymmetr system are use to first exchang a secret key and then secur commun proce via a more effici symmetr system use that key exampl of asymmetr system includ diffiehellman key exchang rsa rivestshamiradleman ecc ellipt curv cryptographi and postquantum cryptographi secur symmetr algorithm includ the commonli use ae advanc encrypt standard which replac the older de data encrypt standard insecur symmetr algorithm includ children languag tangl scheme such as pig latin or other cant and all histor cryptograph scheme howev serious intend prior to the invent of the onetim pad earli in the centuri in colloqui use the term code is often use to mean ani method of encrypt or conceal of mean howev in cryptographi code ha a more specif mean the replac of a unit of plaintext ie a meaning word or phrase with a code word for exampl wallabi replac attack at dawn a cypher in contrast is a scheme for chang or substitut an element below such a level a letter a syllabl or a pair of letter etc in order to produc a cyphertext cryptanalysi is the term use for the studi of method for obtain the mean of encrypt inform without access to the key normal requir to do so ie it is the studi of how to crack encrypt algorithm or their implement some use the term cryptographi and cryptolog interchang in english while other includ us militari practic gener use cryptographi to refer specif to the use and practic of cryptograph techniqu and cryptolog to refer to the combin studi of cryptographi and cryptanalysi english is more flexibl than sever other languag in which cryptolog done by cryptologist is alway use in the second sens abov rfc advis that steganographi is sometim includ in cryptologyth studi of characterist of languag that have some applic in cryptographi or cryptolog eg frequenc data letter combin univers pattern etc is call cryptolinguist cryptolingusit is especi use in militari intellig applic for deciph foreign commun histori befor the modern era cryptographi focus on messag confidenti ie encryptionconvers of messag from a comprehens form into an incomprehens one and back again at the other end render it unread by interceptor or eavesdropp without secret knowledg name the key need for decrypt of that messag encrypt attempt to ensur secreci in commun such as those of spi militari leader and diplomat in recent decad the field ha expand beyond confidenti concern to includ techniqu for messag integr check senderreceiv ident authent digit signatur interact proof and secur comput among other classic cryptographi the main classic cipher type are transposit cipher which rearrang the order of letter in a messag eg hello world becom ehlol owrdl in a trivial simpl rearrang scheme and substitut cipher which systemat replac letter or group of letter with other letter or group of letter eg fli at onc becom gmz bu podf by replac each letter with the one follow it in the latin alphabet simpl version of either have never offer much confidenti from enterpris oppon an earli substitut cipher wa the caesar cipher in which each letter in the plaintext wa replac by a letter some fix number of posit further down the alphabet suetoniu report that juliu caesar use it with a shift of three to commun with hi gener atbash is an exampl of an earli hebrew cipher the earliest known use of cryptographi is some carv ciphertext on stone in egypt c bce but thi may have been done for the amus of liter observ rather than as a way of conceal inform the greek of classic time are said to have known of cipher eg the scytal transposit cipher claim to have been use by the spartan militari steganographi ie hide even the exist of a messag so as to keep it confidenti wa also first develop in ancient time an earli exampl from herodotu wa a messag tattoo on a slave shave head and conceal under the regrown hair more modern exampl of steganographi includ the use of invis ink microdot and digit watermark to conceal inform in india the kamasutra of vtsyyana speak of two differ kind of cipher call kautiliyam and mulavediya in the kautiliyam the cipher letter substitut are base on phonet relat such as vowel becom conson in the mulavediya the cipher alphabet consist of pair letter and use the reciproc onesin sassanid persia there were two secret script accord to the muslim author ibn alnadim the hdabrya liter king script which wa use for offici correspond and the rzsaharya which wa use to commun secret messag with other countriesdavid kahn note in the codebreak that modern cryptolog origin among the arab the first peopl to systemat document cryptanalyt method alkhalil wrote the book of cryptograph messag which contain the first use of permut and combin to list all possibl arab word with and without vowel ciphertext produc by a classic cipher and some modern cipher will reveal statist inform about the plaintext and that inform can often be use to break the cipher after the discoveri of frequenc analysi perhap by the arab mathematician and polymath alkindi also known as alkindu in the centuri nearli all such cipher could be broken by an inform attack such classic cipher still enjoy popular today though mostli as puzzl see cryptogram alkindi wrote a book on cryptographi entitl risalah fi istikhraj almuamma manuscript for the deciph cryptograph messag which describ the first known use of frequenc analysi cryptanalysi techniqu languag letter frequenc may offer littl help for some extend histor encrypt techniqu such as homophon cipher that tend to flatten the frequenc distribut for those cipher languag letter group or ngram frequenc may provid an attack essenti all cipher remain vulner to cryptanalysi use the frequenc analysi techniqu until the develop of the polyalphabet cipher most clearli by leon battista alberti around the year though there is some indic that it wa alreadi known to alkindi alberti innov wa to use differ cipher ie substitut alphabet for variou part of a messag perhap for each success plaintext letter at the limit he also invent what wa probabl the first automat cipher devic a wheel that implement a partial realiz of hi invent in the vigenr cipher a

prove that the onetim pad cipher is unbreak provid the key materi is truli random never reus kept secret from all possibl attack and of equal or greater length than the messag most cipher apart from the onetim pad can be broken with enough comput effort by brute forc attack but the amount of effort need may be exponenti depend on the key size as compar to the effort need to make use of the cipher in such case effect secur could be achiev if it is proven that the effort requir ie work factor in shannon term is beyond the abil of ani adversari thi mean it must be shown that no effici method as

to write or logion study respectively is the practice and study of technique for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior more generally cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocol that prevent third party or the public from reading private message modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the discipline of mathematics computer science information security electrical engineering digital signal processing physic and others core concept related to information security data confidentiality data integrity authentication and nonrepudiation are also central to cryptography practical application of cryptography include electronic commerce chipbased payment card digital currency computer password and military communication cryptography prior to the modern age wa effectively synonymous with encryption converting readable information plaintext to unintelligible nonsense text ciphertext which can only be read by reversing the process decryption the sender of an encrypted coded message share the decryption decoding technique only with the intended recipient to preclude access from adversary the cryptography literature often us the name alice or a for the sender bob or b for the intended recipient and eve or e for the eavesdropping adversary since the development of rotor cipher machine in world war i and the advent of computer in world war ii cryptography method have become increasingly complex and their application more varied modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice cryptographic algorithm are designed around computational hardness assumption making such algorithm hard to break in actual practice by any adversary while it is theoretically possible to break into a welldesigned system it is infeasible in actual practice to do so such scheme if well designed are therefore termed computationally secure theoretical advance eg improvement in integer factorization algorithm and faster computing technology require these design to be continually reevaluated and if necessary adapted informationtheoretically secure scheme that provably can not be broken even with unlimited computing power such a the onetime pad are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure scheme the growth of cryptographic technology ha raised a number of legal issue in the information age cryptography potential for use a a tool for espionage and sedition ha led many government to classify it a a weapon and to limit or even prohibit it use and export in some jurisdiction where the use of cryptography is legal law permit investigator to compel the disclosure of encryption key for document relevant to an investigation cryptography also play a major role in digital right management and copyright infringement dispute with regard to digital medium terminology the first use of the term cryptograph a opposed to cryptogram date back to the centuryoriginating from the goldbug a story by edgar allan poeuntil modern time cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption which is the process of converting ordinary information called plaintext into an unintelligible form called ciphertext decryption is the reverse in other word moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext a cipher or cypher is a pair of algorithm that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption the detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a key the key is a secret ideally known only to the communicant usually a string of character ideally short so it can be remembered by the user which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext in formal mathematical term a cryptosystem is the ordered list of element of finite possible plaintexts finite possible cyphertexts finite possible key and the encryption and decryption algorithm that correspond to each key key are important both formally and in actual practice a cipher without variable key can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless or even counterproductive for most purpose historically cipher were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedure such a authentication or integrity check there are two main type of cryptosystems symmetric and asymmetric in symmetric system the only one known until the the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message data manipulation in symmetric system is significantly faster than in asymmetric system asymmetric system use a public key to encrypt a message and a related private key to decrypt it the advantage of asymmetric system is that the public key can be freely published allowing party to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key in practice asymmetric system are used to first exchange a secret key and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key example of asymmetric system include diffiehellman key exchange rsa rivestshamiradleman ecc elliptic curve cryptography and postquantum cryptography secure symmetric algorithm include the commonly used aes advanced encryption standard which replaced the older de data encryption standard insecure symmetric algorithm include childrens language tangling scheme such a pig latin or other cant and all historical cryptographic scheme however seriously intended prior to the invention of the onetime pad early in the century in colloquial use the term code is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning however in cryptography code ha a more specific meaning the replacement of a unit of plaintext ie a meaningful word or phrase with a code word for example wallaby replaces attack at dawn a cypher in contrast is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level a letter a syllable or a pair of letter etc in order to produce a cyphertext cryptanalysis is the term used for the study of method for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so ie it is the study of how to crack encryption algorithm or their implementation some use the term cryptography and cryptology interchangeably in english while others including u military practice generally use cryptography to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic technique and cryptology to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis english is more flexible than several other language in which cryptology done by cryptologist is always used in the second sense above rfc advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptologythe study of characteristic of language that have some application in cryptography or cryptology eg frequency data letter combination universal pattern etc is called cryptolinguistics cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence application for deciphering foreign communication history before the modern era cryptography focused on message confidentiality ie encryptionconversion of message from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end rendering it unreadable by interceptor or eavesdropper without secret knowledge namely the key needed for decryption of that message encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communication such a those of spy military leader and diplomat in recent decade the field ha expanded beyond confidentiality concern to include technique for message integrity checking senderreceiver identity authentication digital signature interactive proof and secure computation among others classic cryptography the main classical cipher type are transposition cipher which rearrange the order of letter in a message eg hello world becomes ehlol owrdl in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme and substitution cipher which systematically replace letter or group of letter with other letter or group of letter eg fly at once becomes gmz bu podf by replacing each letter with the one following it in the latin alphabet simple version of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponent an early substitution cipher wa the caesar cipher in which each letter in the plaintext wa replaced by a letter some fixed number of position further down the alphabet suetonius report that julius caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his general atbash is an example of an early hebrew cipher the earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in egypt c bce but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observer rather than a a way of concealing information the greek of classical time are said to have known of cipher eg the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the spartan military steganography ie hiding even the existence of a message so a to keep it confidential wa also first developed in ancient time an early example from herodotus wa a message tattooed on a slave shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair more modern example of steganography include the use of invisible ink microdot and digital watermark to conceal information in india the kamasutra of vtsyyana speaks of two different kind of cipher called kautiliyam and mulavediya in the kautiliyam the cipher letter substitution are based on phonetic relation such a vowel becoming consonant in the mulavediya the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letter and using the reciprocal onesin sassanid persia there were two secret script according to the muslim author ibn alnadim the hdabrya literally king script which wa used for official correspondence and the rzsaharya which wa used to communicate secret message with other countriesdavid kahn note in the codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the arab the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic method alkhalil wrote the book of cryptographic message which contains the first use of permutation and combination to list all possible arabic word with and without vowel ciphertexts produced by a classical cipher and some modern cipher will reveal statistical information about the plaintext and that information can often be used to break the cipher after the discovery of frequency analysis perhaps by the arab mathematician and polymath alkindi also known a alkindus in the century nearly all such cipher could be broken by an informed attacker such classical cipher still enjoy popularity today though mostly a puzzle see cryptogram alkindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled risalah fi istikhraj almuamma manuscript for the deciphering cryptographic message which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis technique language letter frequency may offer little help for some extended historical encryption technique such a homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution for those cipher language letter group or ngram frequency may provide an attack essentially all cipher remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher most clearly by leon battista alberti around the year though there is some indication that it wa already known to alkindi alberti innovation wa to use different cipher ie substitution alphabet for various part of a message perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit he also invented what wa probably the first automatic cipher device a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention in the vigenre cipher a polyalphabetic cipher encryption us a key word which control letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used in the century charles babbage showed that the vigenre cipher wa vulnerable to kasiski examination but this wa first published about ten year later by friedrich kasiskialthough frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many cipher encryption ha still often been effective in practice a many a wouldbe cryptanalyst wa unaware of the technique breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved thus making espionage bribery burglary defection etc more attractive approach to the cryptanalytically uninformed it wa finally explicitly recognized in the century that secrecy of a cipher algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security in fact it wa further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme including cipher should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack this fundamental principle wa first explicitly stated in by auguste kerckhoffs and is generally called kerckhoffss principle alternatively and more bluntly it wa restated by claude shannon the inventor of information theory and the fundamental of theoretical cryptography a shannon maximthe enemy know the system different physical device and aid have been used to assist with cipher one of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient greece a rod supposedly used by the spartan a an aid for a transposition cipher in medieval time other aid were invented such a the cipher grille which wa also used for a kind of steganography with the invention of polyalphabetic cipher came more sophisticated aid such a alberti own cipher disk johannes trithemius tabula rectum scheme and thomas jefferson wheel cypher not publicly known and reinvented independently by bazeries around many mechanical encryptiondecryption device were invented early in the century and several patented among them rotor machinesfamously including the enigma machine used by the german government and military from the late and during world war ii the cipher implemented by better quality example of these machine design brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after wwi early computerera cryptography cryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering device proved to be both difficult and laborious in the united kingdom cryptanalytic effort at bletchley park during wwii spurred the development of more efficient mean for carrying out repetitive task such a military code breaking decryption this culminated in the development of the colossus the world first fully electronic digital programmable computer which assisted in the decryption of cipher generated by the german army lorenz machine extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent beginning in the in the early ibm personnel designed the data encryption standard de algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the united state in whitfield diffie and martin hellman published the diffiehellman key exchange algorithm in the rsa algorithm wa published in martin gardner scientific american column since then cryptography ha become a widely used tool in communication computer network and computer security generally some modern cryptographic technique can only keep their key secret if certain mathematical problem are intractable such a the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problem so there are deep connection with abstract mathematics there are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure the onetime pad is one and wa proven to be so by claude shannon there are a few important algorithm that have been proven secure under certain assumption for example the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integer is the basis for believing that rsa is secure and some other system but even so proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open in practice these are widely used and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observer there are system similar to rsa such a one by michael o rabin that are provably secure provided factoring n pq is impossible it is quite unusable in practice the discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure and again there are related le practical system that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problemas well a being aware of cryptographic history cryptographic algorithm and system designer must also sensibly consider probable future development while working on their design for instance continuous improvement in computer processing power have increased the scope of bruteforce attack so when specifying key length the required key length are similarly advancing the potential impact of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designer developing postquantum cryptography the announced imminence of small implementation of these machine may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative modern cryptography prior to the early century cryptography wa mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic pattern since then cryptography ha broadened in scope and now make extensive use of mathematical subdisciplines including information theory computational complexity statistic combinatorics abstract algebra number theory and finite mathematics cryptography is also a branch of engineering but an unusual one since it deal with active intelligent and malevolent opposition other kind of engineering eg civil or chemical engineering need deal only with neutral natural force there is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problem and quantum physic just a the development of digital computer and electronics helped in cryptanalysis it made possible much more complex cipher furthermore computer allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format unlike classical cipher which only encrypted written language text this wa new and significant computer use ha thus supplanted linguistic cryptography both for cipher design and cryptanalysis many computer cipher can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequence sometimes in group or block unlike classical and mechanical scheme which generally manipulate traditional character ie letter and digit directly however computer have also assisted cryptanalysis which ha compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity nonetheless good modern cipher have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient ie fast and requiring few resource such a memory or cpu capability while breaking it requires an effort many order of magnitude larger and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical a to be effectively impossible modern cryptography symmetrickey cryptography symmetrickey cryptography refers to encryption method in which both the sender and receiver share the same key or le commonly in which their key are different but related in an easily computable way this wa the only kind of encryption publicly known until june symmetric key cipher are implemented a either block cipher or stream cipher a block cipher enciphers input in block of plaintext a opposed to individual character the input form used by a stream cipher the data encryption standard de and the advanced encryption standard aes are block cipher design that have been designated cryptography standard by the u government though des designation wa finally withdrawn after the aes wa adopted despite it deprecation a an official standard de especially it stillapproved and much more secure tripledes variant remains quite popular it is used across a wide range of application from atm encryption to email privacy and secure remote access many other block cipher have been designed and released with considerable variation in quality many even some designed by capable practitioner have been thoroughly broken such a fealstream cipher in contrast to the block type create an arbitrarily long stream of key material which is combined with the plaintext bitbybit or characterbycharacter somewhat like the onetime pad in a stream cipher the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that change a the cipher operates that internal state is initially set up using the secret key material is a widely used stream cipher block cipher can be used a stream cipher by generating block of a keystream in place of a pseudorandom number generator and applying an xor operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystreammessage authentication code mac are much like cryptographic hash function except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt this additional complication block an attack scheme against bare digest algorithm and so ha been thought worth the effort cryptographic hash function are a third type of cryptographic algorithm they take a message of any length a input and output a short fixedlength hash which can be used in for example a digital signature for good hash function an attacker can not find two message that produce the same hash is a longused hash function that is now broken a strengthened variant of is also widely used but broken in practice the u national security agency developed the secure hash algorithm series of hash function wa a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew is widely deployed and more secure than but cryptanalyst have identified attack against it the family improves on but is vulnerable to clash a of and the u standard authority thought it prudent from a security perspective to develop a new standard to significantly improve the robustness of nist overall hash algorithm toolkit thus a hash function design competition wa meant to select a new u national standard to be called by the competition ended on october when the nist announced that keccak would be the new hash algorithm unlike block and stream cipher that are invertible cryptographic hash function produce a hashed output that can not be used to retrieve the original input data cryptographic hash function are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security publickey cryptography symmetrickey cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message although a message or group of message can have a different key than others a significant disadvantage of symmetric cipher is the key management necessary to use them securely each distinct pair of communicating party must ideally share a different key and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged a well the number of key required increase a the square of the number of network member which very quickly requires complex key management scheme to keep them all consistent and secret in a groundbreaking paper whitfield diffie and martin hellman proposed the notion of publickey also more generally called asymmetric key cryptography in which two different but mathematically related key are useda public key and a private key a public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key the private key is computationally infeasible from the other the public key even though they are necessarily related instead both key are generated secretly a an interrelated pair the historian david kahn described publickey cryptography a the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the renaissancein publickey cryptosystems the public key may be freely distributed while it paired private key must remain secret in a publickey encryption system the public key is used for encryption while the private or secret key is used for decryption while diffie and hellman could not find such a system they showed that publickey cryptography wa indeed possible by presenting the diffiehellman key exchange protocol a solution that is now widely used in secure communication to allow two party to secretly agree on a shared encryption key the standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificatesdiffie and hellman publication sparked widespread academic effort in finding a practical publickey encryption system this race wa finally won in by ronald rivest adi shamir and len adleman whose solution ha since become known a the rsa algorithmthe diffiehellman and rsa algorithm in addition to being the first publicly known example of highquality publickey algorithm have been among the most widely used other asymmetrickey algorithm include the cramershoup cryptosystem elgamal encryption and various elliptic curve techniquesa document published in by the government communication headquarters gchq a british intelligence organization revealed that cryptographer at gchq had anticipated several academic development reportedly around james h elli had conceived the principle of asymmetric key cryptography in clifford cock invented a solution that wa very similar in design rationale to rsa in malcolm j williamson is claimed to have developed the diffiehellman key exchange publickey cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature scheme a digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce but difficult for anyone else to forge digital signature can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed they can not then be moved from one document to another for any attempt will be detectable in digital signature scheme there are two algorithm one for signing in which a secret key is used to process the message or a hash of the message or both and one for verification in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature rsa and dsa are two of the most popular digital signature scheme digital signature are central to the operation of public key infrastructure and many network security scheme eg ssltls many vpns etcpublickey algorithm are most often based on the computational complexity of hard problem often from number theory for example the hardness of rsa is related to the integer factorization problem while diffiehellman and dsa are related to the discrete logarithm problem the security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problem involving elliptic curve because of the difficulty of the underlying problem most publickey algorithm involve operation such a modular multiplication and exponentiation which are much more computationally expensive than the technique used in most block cipher especially with typical key size a a result publickey cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems in which a fast highquality symmetrickey encryption algorithm is used for the message itself while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message but encrypted using a publickey algorithm similarly hybrid signature scheme are often used in which a cryptographic hash function is computed and only the resulting hash is digitally signed cryptographic hash function cryptographic hash function are function that take a variablelength input and return a fixedlength output which can be used in for example a digital signature for a hash function to be secure it must be difficult to compute two input that hash to the same value collision resistance and to compute an input that hash to a given output preimage resistance is a longused hash function that is now broken a strengthened variant of is also widely used but broken in practice the u national security agency developed the secure hash algorithm series of hash function wa a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew is widely deployed and more secure than but cryptanalyst have identified attack against it the family improves on but is vulnerable to clash a of and the u standard authority thought it prudent from a security perspective to develop a new standard to significantly improve the robustness of nist overall hash algorithm toolkit thus a hash function design competition wa meant to select a new u national standard to be called by the competition ended on october when the nist announced that keccak would be the new hash algorithm unlike block and stream cipher that are invertible cryptographic hash function produce a hashed output that can not be used to retrieve the original input data cryptographic hash function are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security cryptanalysis the goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme thus permitting it subversion or evasion it is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken in connection with his wwii work at bell lab claude shannon proved that the onetime pad cipher is unbreakable provided the key material is truly random never reused kept secret from all possible attacker and of equal or greater length than the message most cipher apart from the onetime pad can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size a compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher in such case effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required ie work factor in shannon term is beyond the ability of any adversary this mean it must be shown that no efficient method a opposed to the timeconsuming brute force method can be found to break the cipher since no such proof ha been found to date the onetimepad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher although wellimplemented onetimepad encryption can not be broken traffic analysis is still possible there are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attack and they can be classified in any of several way a common distinction turn on what eve an attacker know and what capability are available in a ciphertextonly attack eve ha access only to the ciphertext good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertextonly attack in a knownplaintext attack eve ha access to a ciphertext and it corresponding plaintext or to many such pair in a chosenplaintext attack eve may choose a plaintext and learn it corresponding ciphertext perhaps many time an example is gardening used by the british during wwii in a chosenciphertext attack eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts finally in a maninthemiddle attack eve get in between alice the sender and bob the recipient access and modifies the traffic and then forward it to the recipient also important often overwhelmingly so are mistake generally in the design or use of one of the protocol involved cryptanalysis of symmetrickey cipher typically involves looking for attack against the block cipher or stream cipher that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher for example a simple brute force attack against de requires one known plaintext and decryption trying approximately half of the possible key to reach a point at which chance are better than even that the key sought will have been found but this may not be enough assurance a linear cryptanalysis attack against de requires known plaintexts with their corresponding ciphertexts and approximately de operation this is a considerable improvement over brute force attack publickey algorithm are based on the computational difficulty of various problem the most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithm both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time p using only a classical turingcomplete computer much publickey cryptanalysis concern designing algorithm in p that can solve these problem or using other technology such a quantum computer for instance the bestknown algorithm for solving the elliptic curvebased version of discrete logarithm are much more timeconsuming than the bestknown algorithm for factoring at least for problem of more or le equivalent size thus to achieve an equivalent strength of encryption technique that depend upon the difficulty of factoring large composite number such a the rsa cryptosystem require larger key than elliptic curve technique for this reason publickey cryptosystems based on elliptic curve have become popular since their invention in the while pure cryptanalysis us weakness in the algorithm themselves other attack on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithm in real device and are called sidechannel attack if a cryptanalyst ha access to for example the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or pin character they may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis an attacker might also study the pattern and length of message to derive valuable information this is known a traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary poor administration of a cryptosystem such a permitting too short key will make any system vulnerable regardless of other virtue social engineering and other attack against human eg bribery extortion blackmail espionage rubberhose cryptanalysis or torture are usually employed due to being more costeffective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin cryptographic primitive much of the theoretical work in cryptography concern cryptographic primitivesalgorithms with basic cryptographic propertiesand their relationship to other cryptographic problem more complicated cryptographic tool are then built from these basic primitive these primitive provide fundamental property which are used to develop more complex tool called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocol which guarantee one or more highlevel security property note however that the distinction between cryptographic primitive and cryptosystems is quite arbitrary for example the rsa algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem and sometimes a primitive typical example of cryptographic primitive include pseudorandom function oneway function etc cryptosystems one or more cryptographic primitive are often used to develop a more complex algorithm called a cryptographic system or cryptosystem cryptosystems eg elgamal encryption are designed to provide particular functionality eg public key encryption while guaranteeing certain security property eg chosenplaintext attack cpa security in the random oracle model cryptosystems use the property of the underlying cryptographic primitive to support the system security property a the distinction between primitive and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems in many case the cryptosystems structure involves back and forth communication among two or more party in space eg between the sender of a secure message and it receiver or across time eg cryptographically protected backup data such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocol some widely known cryptosystems include rsa schnorr signature elgamal encryption and pretty good privacy pgp more complex cryptosystems include electronic cash system signcryption system etc some more theoretical cryptosystems include interactive proof system like zeroknowledge proof and system for secret sharing lightweight cryptography lightweight cryptography lwc concern cryptographic algorithm developed for a strictly constrained environment the growth of internet of thing iot ha spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithm that are better suited for the environment an iot environment requires strict constraint on power consumption processing power and security algorithm such a present aes and speck are example of the many lwc algorithm that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the national institute of standard and technology application cryptography is widely used on the internet to help protect userdata and prevent eavesdropping to ensure secrecy during transmission many system use private key cryptography to protect transmitted information with publickey system one can maintain secrecy without a master key or a large number of key but some algorithm like bitlocker and veracrypt are generally not privatepublic key cryptography for example veracrypt us a password hash to generate the single private key however it can be configured to run in publicprivate key system the c opensource encryption library openssl provides free and opensource encryption software and tool the most commonly used encryption cipher suit is aes a it ha hardware acceleration for all based processor that ha aesni a close contender is which is a stream cipher however it is commonly used for mobile device a they are arm based which doe not feature aesni instruction set extension cybersecurity cryptography can be used to secure communication by encrypting them website use encryption via http endtoend encryption where only sender and receiver can read message is implemented for email in pretty good privacy and for secure messaging in general in whatsapp signal and telegramoperating system use encryption to keep password secret conceal part of the system and ensure that software update are truly from the system maker instead of storing plaintext password computer system store hash thereof then when a user log in the system pass the given password through a cryptographic hash function and compare it to the hashed value on file in this manner neither the system nor an attacker ha at any point access to the password in plaintextencryption is sometimes used to encrypt one entire drive for example university college london ha implemented bitlocker a program by microsoft to render drive data opaque without user logging in cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics cryptographic technique enable cryptocurrency technology such a distributed ledger technology eg blockchains which finance cryptoeconomics application such a decentralized finance defi key cryptographic technique that enable cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics include but are not limited to cryptographic key cryptographic hash function asymmetric public key encryption multifactor authentication mfa endtoend encryption and zero knowledge proof zkp legal issue prohibition cryptography ha long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agency secret communication may be criminal or even treasonous because of it facilitation of privacy and the diminution of privacy attendant on it prohibition cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil right supporter accordingly there ha been a history of controversial legal issue surrounding cryptography especially since the advent of inexpensive computer ha made widespread access to highquality cryptography possible in some country even the domestic use of cryptography is or ha been restricted until france significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically though it ha since relaxed many of these rule in china and iran a license is still required to use cryptography many country have tight restriction on the use of cryptography among the more restrictive are law in belarus kazakhstan mongolia pakistan singapore tunisia and vietnamin the united state cryptography is legal for domestic use but there ha been much conflict over legal issue related to cryptography one particularly important issue ha been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in world war ii and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security many western government have at some point strictly regulated export of cryptography after world war ii it wa illegal in the u to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas in fact encryption wa designated a auxiliary military equipment and put on the united state munition list until the development of the personal computer asymmetric key algorithm ie public key technique and the internet this wa not especially problematic however a the internet grew and computer became more widely available highquality encryption technique became well known around the globe export control in the there were several challenge to u export regulation of cryptography after the source code for philip zimmermanns pretty good privacy pgp encryption program found it way onto the internet in june a complaint by rsa security then called rsa data security inc resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of zimmermann by the u custom service and the fbi though no charge were ever filed daniel j bernstein then a graduate student at uc berkeley brought a lawsuit against the u government challenging some aspect of the restriction based on free speech ground the case bernstein v united state ultimately resulted in a decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithm and system wa protected a free speech by the united state constitutionin thirtynine country signed the wassenaar arrangement an arm control treaty that deal with the export of arm and dualuse technology such a cryptography the treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short keylengths for symmetric encryption for rsa would no longer be exportcontrolled cryptography export from the u became le strictly regulated a a consequence of a major relaxation in there are no longer very many restriction on key size in usexported massmarket software since this relaxation in u export restriction and because most personal computer connected to the internet include ussourced web browser such a firefox or internet explorer almost every internet user worldwide ha potential access to quality cryptography via their browser eg via transport layer security the mozilla thunderbird and microsoft outlook email client program similarly can transmit and receive email via tl and can send and receive email encrypted with smime many internet user do not realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems these browser and email program are so ubiquitous that even government whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally do not find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality so even when such law are in force actual enforcement is often effectively impossible nsa involvement another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the united state is the influence of the national security agency on cipher development and policy the nsa wa involved with the design of de during it development at ibm and it consideration by the national bureau of standard a a possible federal standard for cryptography de wa designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the nsa and ibm that became publicly known only when it wa rediscovered in the late according to steven levy ibm discovered differential cryptanalysis but kept the technique secret at the nsa request the technique became publicly known only when biham and shamir rediscovered and announced it some year later the entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resource and knowledge an attacker might actually have another instance of the nsa involvement wa the clipper chip affair an encryption microchip intended to be part of the capstone cryptographycontrol initiative clipper wa widely criticized by cryptographer for two reason the cipher algorithm called skipjack wa then classified declassified in long after the clipper initiative lapsed the classified cipher caused concern that the nsa had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist it intelligence effort the whole initiative wa also criticized based on it violation of kerckhoffss principle a the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement ie wiretapping digital right management cryptography is central to digital right management drm a group of technique for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holder in u president bill clinton signed the digital millennium copyright act dmca which criminalized all production dissemination and use of certain cryptanalytic technique and technology now known or later discovered specifically those that could be used to circumvent drm technological scheme this had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the dmca similar statute have since been enacted in several country and region including the implementation in the eu copyright directive similar restriction are called for by treaty signed by world intellectual property organization memberstates the united state department of justice and fbi have not enforced the dmca a rigorously a had been feared by some but the law nonetheless remains a controversial one niels ferguson a wellrespected cryptography researcher ha publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an intel security design for fear of prosecution under the dmca cryptologist bruce schneier ha argued that the dmca encourages vendor lockin while inhibiting actual measure toward cybersecurity both alan cox longtime linux kernel developer and edward felten and some of his student at princeton have encountered problem related to the act dmitry sklyarov wa arrested during a visit to the u from russia and jailed for five month pending trial for alleged violation of the dmca arising from work he had done in russia where the work wa legal in the cryptographic key responsible for bluray and hd dvd content scrambling were discovered and released onto the internet in both case the motion picture association of america sent out numerous dmca takedown notice and there wa a massive internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notice on fair use and free speech forced disclosure of encryption key in the united kingdom the regulation of investigatory power act give uk police the power to force suspect to decrypt file or hand over password that protect encryption key failure to comply is an offense in it own right punishable on conviction by a twoyear jail sentence or up to five year in case involving national security successful prosecution have occurred under the act the first in resulted in a term of month imprisonment similar forced disclosure law in australia finland france and india compel individual suspect under investigation to hand over encryption key or password during a criminal investigation in the united state the federal criminal case of united state v fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password the electronic frontier foundation eff argued that this is a violation of the protection from selfincrimination given by the fifth amendment in the court ruled that under the all writ act the defendant wa required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the courtin many jurisdiction the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear the fbiapple encryption dispute concern the ability of court in the united state to compel

information technology security it security is the protection of computer system and network from attack by malicious actor that may result in unauthorized information disclosure theft of or damage to hardware software or data a well a from the disruption or misdirection of the service they providethe field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer system the internet and wireless network standard such a bluetooth and wifi also due to the growth of smart device including smartphones television and the various device that constitute the internet of thing iot cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenge of the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information system and the society they support security is of especially high importance for system that govern largescale system with farreaching physical effect such a power distribution election and finance vulnerability and attack a vulnerability is a weakness in design implementation operation or internal control of a computer or system most of the vulnerability that have been discovered are documented in the common vulnerability and exposure cve database an exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists vulnerability can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tool or customized scriptsvarious people or party are vulnerable to cyber attack however different group are likely to experience different type of attack more than othersin april the united kingdom department for science innovation technology realised a report on cyber attack over the last month they surveyed uk business uk registered charity and education institution the research found that of business and of charity overall recall any breach or attack from the last month this figure were much higher for medium business large business and highincome charity with or more in annual income yet although medium or large business are more often the victim since larger company have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize business smbs have also become increasing vulnerable a they often do not have advanced tool to defend the business smbs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attack and denialof service do attacksnormal people working for a business or simply using the internet are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyber attack these are where attacker indiscriminately target a many device service or user a possible they do this using technique that take advantage of the openness of the internet these strategy mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanningto secure a computer system it is important to understand the attack that can be made against it and these threat can typically be classified into one of the following category backdoor a backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security control these weakness may exist for many reason including original design or poor configuration due to the nature of backdoor they are of greater concern to company and database a opposed to individual backdoor may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reason however criminal often use malware to install backdoor giving them remote administrative access to a system once they have access cybercriminals can modify file steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computerbackdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who ha access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer denialofservice attack denial of service attack do are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to it intended user attacker can deny service to individual victim such a by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive time to cause the victim account to be locked or they may overload the capability of a machine or network and block all user at once while a network attack from a single ip address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many form of distributed denial of service ddos attack are possible where the attack come from a large number of point and defending is much more difficult such attack can originate from the zombie computer of a botnet or from a range of other possible technique including distributed reflective denial of service drdos where innocent system are fooled into sending traffic to the victim with such attack the amplification factor make the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves to understand why attacker may carry out these attack see the attacker motivation section directaccess attack a directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gain physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or to steal information attacker may also compromise security by making operating system modification installing software worm keyloggers covert listening device or using wireless microphone even when the system is protected by standard security measure these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a cdrom or other bootable medium disk encryption and trusted platform module are designed to prevent these attack direct service attacker are related in concept to direct memory attack that allows an attacker to gain direct access to a computer memory the attack take advantage of a feature of modern computer that allow certain device such a external hard drive graphic card or network card to access the computer memory directlyto help prevent these attack computer user must ensure that they have a strong password that their computer is locked at all time when they are not using it and that they keep their computer with them at all time when traveling eavesdropping eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between host on a network it typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various method unlike malware directaccess attack or other form of cyber attack eavesdropping attack are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of network or device making them difficult to notice in fact the attacker doe not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all he or she can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined timeusing a virtual private network vpn which encrypts data between two point is one of the most common form of protection against eavesdropping using the best form of encryption possible for wireless network is best practice a well a using http instead of unencrypted httpprograms such a carnivore and narusinsight have been used by the federal bureau of investigation fbi and nsa to eavesdrop on the system of internet service provider even machine that operate a a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmission generated by the hardware tempest is a specification by the nsa referring to these attack malware malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or it user once present on a computer it can leak sensitive detail such a personal information business information and password can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victim machine encrypts their file and then turn around and demand a ransom usually in bitcoin to return that data to the usertypes of malware include some of the following virus are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijack software with the intension to do damage and spread copy of itself copy are made with the aim to spread to other program on a computer worm are similar to virus however virus can only function when a user run open a comprised program worm therefore are selfreplicating malware that spread between program apps and device without the need for human interaction trojan horse are program that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick user into installing them once installed a rat remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device spyware is a type of malware that secretly gather information on an infected computer and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker one of the most common form of spyware are known a keyloggers which is a kind of malware which recorder all of a user keyboard inputskeystrokes used to allow hacker to harvest usernames password bank account and credit card number scareware a the name suggests is a form of malware which us social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate user into buying or installing unwanted software these attack often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device ha a virus multivector polymorphic attack surfacing in a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threat combined several type of attack and changed form to avoid cybersecurity control a they spread multivector polymorphic attack a the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic firstly they are a singular offensive that involves multiple method of attack in this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple mean of propagation such a via the web email and application however they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate network and move laterally inside the network the attack can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such a virus worm or trojan constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defence phishing phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such a usernames password and credit card detail directly from user by deceiving the user phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call and it often directs user to enter detail at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one the fake website often asks for personal information such a login detail and password this information can then be used to gain access to the individual real account on the real website preying on a victim trust phishing can be classified a a form of social engineering attacker are using creative way to gain access to real account a common scam is for attacker to send fake electronic invoice to individual showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchase were not authorized a more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverage personal or organizationspecific detail to make the attacker appear like a trusted source spearphishing attack target specific individual rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempt privilege escalation privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privilege or access level for example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system the severity of attack can range from attack simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amount of data privilege escalation usually start with social engineering technique often phishingprivilege escalation can be separated into to strategy horizontal and vertical privilege escalation horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gain access to a normal user account that ha relatively lowlevel privilege this may be through stealing the user username and password once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of user at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege vertical escalation however target people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such a an employee in it with a higher privilege using this privileged account will then enable to attacker to invade other account sidechannel attack any computational system affect it environment in some form this effect it ha on it environment includes a wide range of criterion which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on ram cell which a a consequence make a cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation fault that allow for access and or guessing of other value that normally should be inaccessible in sidechannel attack scenario the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess it internal state and a a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure social engineering social engineering in the context of computer security aim to convince a user to disclose secret such a password card number etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer this generally involves exploiting people trust and relying on their cognitive bias a common scam involves email sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their ceo and urgently requesting some action one of the main technique of social engineering are phishing attack in early the fbi reported that such business email compromise bec scam had cost u business more than billion in about two yearsin may the milwaukee buck nba team wa the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team president peter feigin resulting in the handover of all the team employee tax form spoofing spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such a an ip address or username in order to gain access to information or resource that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain spoofing is closely related to phishing there are several type of spoofing including email spoofing is where an attacker forge the sending from or source address of an email ip address spoofing where an attacker alters the source ip address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system mac spoofing where an attacker modifies the medium access control mac address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose a another biometric spoofing where an attacker produce a fake biometric sample to pose a another user address resolution protocol arp spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their medium access control address with a different host ip address this cause data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended hostin the cybersecurity firm trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry tampering tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data an intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system component of system it intended behavior or data socalled evil maid attack and security service planting of surveillance capability into router are example html smuggling html smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular html or web page html file can carry payload concealed a benign inert data in order to defeat content filter these payload can be reconstructed on the other side of the filterwhen a target user open the html the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the target device information security culture employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organization cultural concept can help different segment of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization information security culture is the totality of pattern of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kindsandersson and reimers found that employee often do not see themselves a part of their organization information security effort and often take action that impede organizational change indeed the verizon data breach investigation report which examined security breach discovered of cybersecurity incident involved internal actor within a company research show information security culture need to be improved continuously in information security culture from analysis to change author commented it a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance to manage the information security culture five step should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation preevaluation to identify the awareness of information security within employee and to analyze the current security policy strategic planning to come up with a better awareness program clear target need to be set assembling a team of skilled professional is helpful to achieve it operative planning a good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program implementation four stage should be used to implement the information security culture they arecommitment of the management communication with organizational member course for all organizational member commitment of the employeespostevaluation to ass the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved area of concern computer protection countermeasure in computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be takensome common countermeasure are listed in the following section security by design security by design or alternately secure by design mean that the software ha been designed from the ground up to be secure in this case security is considered a main feature the uk government national cyber security centre separate secure cyber design principle into five section before a secure system is created or updated company should ensure they understand the fundamental and the context around the system they are trying to create and to identify any apart weakness in a system company should design and centre their security around technique and defence which make attacking their data or system inherently more challenging for attacker company should ensure that their core service that rely on technology are protected so that the technology is always available although system can be created which are safe against a multitude of attack that doe not mean that attack will not be attempted despite one security all company system should aim to be able to detect and spot attack a soon a they occur to ensure the most effective response to them company should create secure system designed so that any attack that is successful ha a loss severitythese design principle of security by design can include some of the following technique the principle of least privilege where each part of the system ha only the privilege that are needed for it function that way even if an attacker gain access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystem code review and unit testing approach to make module more secure where formal correctness proof are not possible defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem need to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it hold default secure setting and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authority in order to make it insecure audit trail track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined storing audit trail remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruder from covering their track full disclosure of all vulnerability to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept a short a possible when bug are discovered security architecture security architecture can be defined a the practice of designing computer system to achieve security goal these goal have overlap with the principle of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise in practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new change are safe and meet the security requirement of the organisationsimilarly techopedia defines security architecture a a unified security design that address the necessity and potential risk involved in a certain scenario or environment it also specifies when and where to apply security control the design process is generally reproducible the key attribute of security architecture are the relationship of different component and how they depend on each other determination of control based on risk assessment good practice finance and legal matter the standardization of controlspracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business it and security concern in an organization security measure a state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of the three process threat prevention detection and response these process are based on various policy and system component which include the following limiting the access of individual using user account access control and using cryptography can protect system file and data respectively firewall are by far the most common prevention system from a network security perspective a they can if properly configured shield access to internal network service and block certain kind of attack through packet filtering firewall can be both hardware and softwarebased firewall monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network intrusion detection system id product are designed to detect network attack inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trail and log serve a similar function for individual system response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirement of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protection to notification of legal authority counterattack and the like in some special case the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored a it may happen that not all the compromised resource are detected cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threat and attack forward web proxy solution can prevent the client to visit malicious web page and inspect the content before downloading to the client machinestoday computer security consists mainly of preventive measure like firewall or an exit procedure a firewall can be defined a a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such a the internet they can be implemented a software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most unixbased operating system such a linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic firewall are common amongst machine that are permanently connected to the internet some organization are turning to big data platform such a apache hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threatsin order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known a the cia triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security to achieve those objective administrative physical and technical security measure should be employed the amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when it value is known vulnerability management vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerability especially in software and firmware vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security vulnerability can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerability such a open port insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware in order for these tool to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release typically these update will scan for the new vulnerability that were introduced recently beyond vulnerability scanning many organization contract outside security auditor to run regular penetration test against their system to identify vulnerability in some sector this is a contractual requirement reducing vulnerability the act of assessing and reducing vulnerability to cyber attack is commonly referred to a information technology security assessment they aim to ass system for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerability while formal verification of the correctness of computer system is possible it is not yet common operating system formally verified include and sysgos pikeos but these make up a very small percentage of the market it is possible to reduce an attacker chance by keeping system up to date with security patch and update andor hiring people with expertise in security large company with significant threat can hire security operation centre soc analyst these are specialist in cyber defence with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating report of any new issue and preparing and testing disaster recovery planswhilst no measure can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measure can help mitigate the damage of possible attack the effect of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance outside of formal assessment there are various method of reducing vulnerability two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information it requires something you know a password or pin and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware this increase security a an unauthorized person need both of these to gain access protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attack can only be occur by noncomputer mean which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving people knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing people awareness of threat however even in highly disciplined environment eg military organization social engineering attack can still be difficult to foresee and prevent inoculation derived from inoculation theory seek to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent trick or trap by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempt through exposure to similar or related attempt hardware protection mechanism hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offer an alternative to softwareonly computer security using device and method such a dongle trusted platform module intrusionaware case drive lock disabling usb port and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised each of these is covered in more detail below usb dongle are typically used in software licensing scheme to unlock software capability but they can also be seen a a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device software the dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key the principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such a advanced encryption standard aes provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it another security application for dongle is to use them for accessing webbased content such a cloud software or virtual private network vpns in addition a usb dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer trusted platform module tpms secure device by integrating cryptographic capability onto access device through the use of microprocessor or socalled computersonachip tpms used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware device preventing unauthorized network and data access computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened the firmware or bios is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time drive lock are essentially software tool to encrypt hard drive making them inaccessible to thief tool exist specifically for encrypting external drive a well disabling usb port is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer infected usb dongle connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine network world a the most common hardware threat facing computer network disconnecting or disabling peripheral device like camera gps removable storage etc that are not in use mobileenabled access device are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phone builtin capability such a bluetooth the newer bluetooth low energy le nearfield communication nfc on nonios device and biometric validation such a thumbprint reader a well a qr code reader software designed for mobile device offer new secure way for mobile phone to connect to access control system these control system provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure building iommus allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of component in mobile and desktop computer by utilizing direct memory access protection physical unclonable function pufs can be used a a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuit and hardware providing user the ability to secure the hardware supply chain going into their system secure operating system one use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating system using secure operating system is a good way of ensuring computer security these are system that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluation are common criterion cc secure coding in software engineering secure coding aim to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerability it is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure such system are secure by design beyond this formal verification aim to prove the correctness of the algorithm underlying a system important for cryptographic protocol for example capability and access control list within computer system two of the main security model capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control list acls and rolebased access control rbac an accesscontrol list acl with respect to a computer file system is a list of permission associated with an object an acl specifies which user or system process are granted access to object a well a what operation are allowed on given object rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized user used by the majority of enterprise with more than employee and can implement mandatory access control mac or discretionary access control dac a further approach capabilitybased security ha been mostly restricted to research operating system capability can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design an opensource project in the area is the e language user security training the enduser is widely recognized a the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than of security incident and breach involve some kind of human error among the most commonly recorded form of error and misjudgment are poor password management sending email containing sensitive data and attachment to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading url and to identify fake website and dangerous email attachment a common mistake that user make is saving their user idpassword in their browser to make it easier to log in to banking site this is a gift to attacker who have obtained access to a machine by some mean the risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authenticationas the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all level not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandate but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individual and company from the great majority of cyber threat the focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioner who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and move along the line suggested by major security center to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attack digital hygiene related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and a the analogy with personal hygiene show is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measure to minimize the risk from cyber threat the assumption is that good cyber hygiene practice can give networked user another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attack or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military termthe most common act of digitalcyber hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backup password and ensuring restricted admin right and network firewall a opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threat cyber hygiene mostly regard routine measure that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education it can be thought of a an abstract list of tip or measure that have been demonstrated a having a positive effect on personal andor collective digital security a such these measure can be performed by laypeople not just security expert cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene a computer virus relate to biological virus or pathogen however while the term computer virus wa coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer virus the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps a late a by internet pioneer vint cerf it ha since been adopted by the congress and senate of the united state the fbi eu institution and head of state difficulty of responding to breach responding to attempted security breach is often very difficult for a variety of reason including identifying attacker is difficult a they may operate through proxy temporary anonymous dialup account wireless connection and other anonymizing procedure which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction if they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete log to cover their track the sheer number of attempted attack often by automated vulnerability scanner and computer worm is so large that organization can not spend time pursuing each law enforcement officer often lack the skill interest or budget to pursue attacker in addition the identification of attacker across a network may require log from various point in the network and in many country which may be difficult or timeconsuming to obtainwhere an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdiction now have in place mandatory security breach notification law type of security and privacy system at risk the growth in the number of computer system and the increasing reliance upon them by individual business industry and government mean that there are an increasing number of system at risk financial system the computer system of financial regulator and financial institution like the u security and exchange commission swift investment bank and commercial bank are prominent hacking target for cybercriminals interested in manipulating market and making illicit gain website and apps that accept or store credit card number brokerage account and bank account information are also prominent hacking target because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchase or selling the information on the black market instore payment system and atm have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and pin the ucla internet report surveying the digital future found that the privacy of personal data created barrier to online sale and that more than nine out of internet user were somewhat or very concerned about credit card securitythe most common web technology for improving security between browser and website are named ssl secure socket layer and it successor tl transport layer security identity management and authentication service and domain name service allow company and consumer to engage in secure communication and commerce several version of ssl and tl are commonly used today in application such a web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and voip voiceoverip there are various interoperable implementation of these technology including at least one implementation that is open source open source allows anyone to view the application source code and look for and report vulnerability the credit card company visa and mastercard cooperated to develop the secure emv chip which is embedded in credit card further development include the chip authentication program where bank give customer handheld card reader to perform online secure transaction other development in this arena include the development of technology such a instant issuance which ha enabled shopping mall kiosk acting on behalf of bank to issue onthespot credit card to interested customer utility and industrial equipment computer control function at many utility including coordination of telecommunication the power grid nuclear power plant and valve opening and closing in water and gas network the internet is a potential attack vector for such machine if connected but the stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computer not connected to the internet can be vulnerable in the computer emergency readiness team a division of the department of homeland security investigated hacking incident at energy company aviation the aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex system which could be attacked a simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussion worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmission which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over ocean is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends to mile offshore there is also potential for attack from within an aircraftin europe with the paneuropean network service and newpens and in the u with the nextgen program air navigation service provider are moving to create their own dedicated network many modern passport are now biometric passport containing an embedded microchip that store a digitized photograph and personal information such a name gender and date of birth in addition more country are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud the introduction of the epassport ha assisted border official in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing plan are under way in the u the uk and australia to introduce smartgate kiosk with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology the airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper ticket towards the use of electronic ticket etickets these have been made possible by advance in online credit card transaction in partnership with the airline longdistance bus company are also switching over to eticketing transaction today the consequence of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outage loss of aircraft and even loss of life consumer device desktop computer and laptop are commonly targeted to gather password or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target smartphones tablet computer smart watch and other mobile device such a quantified self device like activity tracker have sensor such a camera microphone gps receiver compass and accelerometer which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information wifi bluetooth and cell phone network on any of these device could be used a attack vector and sensor might be remotely activated after a successful breachthe increasing number of home automation device such a the nest thermostat are also potential target healthcare today many healthcare provider and health insurance company use the internet to provide enhanced product and service for example through use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness tracker to lower insurance premium the health care company humana partner with webmd oracle corporation ed and microsoft to enable it member to access their health care record a well a to provide an overview of health care plan patient record are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse network alleviating the need for extra storage space large corporation large corporation are common target in many case attack are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breach example include the loss of million of client credit card and financial detail by home depot staple target corporation and equifaxmedical record have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patient to obtain prescription drug for recreational purpose or resale although cyber threat continue to increase of all organization did not increase security training for their business in all attack are financially motivated however security firm hbgary federal had a serious series of attack in from hacktivist group anonymous in retaliation for the firm ceo claiming to have infiltrated their group and sony picture wa hacked in with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leak and crippling the company by wiping workstation and server automobile vehicle are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brake seat belt tensioners door lock airbags and advanced driverassistance system on many model additionally connected car may use wifi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer device and the cell phone network selfdriving car are expected to be even more complex all of these system carry some security risk and such issue have gained wide attentionsimple example of risk include a malicious compact disc being used a an attack vector and the car onboard microphone being used for eavesdropping however if access is gained to a car internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized test hacker remotely carjacked a vehicle from mile away and drove it into a ditchmanufacturers are reacting in numerous way with tesla in pushing out some security fix over the air into it car computer system in the area of autonomous vehicle in september the united state department of transportation announced some initial safety standard and called for state to come up with uniform policiesadditionally edrivers license are being developed using the same technology for example mexico licensing authority icv ha used a smart card platform to issue the first edrivers license to the city of monterrey in the state of nuevo len shipping shipping company have adopted rfid radio frequency identification technology a an efficient digitally secure tracking device unlike a barcode rfid can be read up to foot away rfid is used by fedex and ups government government and military computer system are commonly attacked by activist and foreign power local and regional government infrastructure such a traffic light control police and intelligence agency communication personnel record a well a student recordsthe fbi cia and pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their building however the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world more and more company are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology ge acuvision for example offer a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording internet of thing and physical vulnerability the internet of thing iot is the network of physical object such a device vehicle and building that are embedded with electronics software sensor and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data concern have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenge involvedwhile the iot creates opportunity for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased system it also provides opportunity for misuse in particular a the internet of thing spread widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat if a front door lock is connected to the internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone people could stand to lose much more than their credit card number in a world controlled by iotenabled device thief have also used electronic mean to circumvent noninternetconnected hotel door locksan attack that target physical infrastructure andor human life is sometimes referred to a a cyberkinetic attack a iot device and appliance gain currency cyberkinetic attack can become pervasive and significantly damaging medical system medical device have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerability demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted device including pacemaker and insulin pump there are many report of hospital and hospital organization getting hacked including ransomware attack window xp exploit virus and data breach of sensitive data stored on hospital server on december the u food and drug administration released it recommendation for how medical device manufacturer should maintain the security of internetconnected device but no structure for enforcement energy sector in distributed generation system the risk of a cyber attack is real according to daily energy insider an attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just a severe consequence a a natural disaster the district of columbia is considering creating a distributed energy resource der authority within the city with the goal being for customer to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand the dc proposal however would allow thirdparty vendor to create numerous point of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunity for cyber attacker to threaten the electric grid telecommunication perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the sim subscriber identity module card a device that is embedded in most of the world cellular device before any service can be obtained the sim card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment the smart card web server draft standard scws defines the interface to an http server in a smart card test are being conducted to secure ota overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone combination simdvd device are being developed through smart video card technology which embeds a dvdcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular sim card other telecommunication development involving digital security include mobile signature which use the embedded sim card to generate a legally binding electronic signature cost and impact of security breach serious financial damage ha been caused by security breach but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organization involved several computer security consulting firm produce estimate of total worldwide loss attributable to virus and worm attack and to hostile digital act in general the loss estimate by these firm range from billion worm and virus only to billion for all form of covert attack the reliability of these estimate is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotalhowever reasonable estimate of the financial cost of security breach can actually help organization make rational investment decision according to the classic gordonloeb model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach attacker motivation a with physical security the motivation for breach of computer security vary between attacker some are thrillseekers or vandal some are activist others are criminal looking for financial gain statesponsored attacker are now common and well resourced but started with amateur such a markus hess who hacked for the kgb a recounted by clifford stoll in the cuckoo egg attacker motivation can vary for all type of attack from pleasure to for political goal for example hacktivists may target a company a company or organisation that carry out activity they do not agree with this would be to create bad publicity for the company by having it website crash high capability hacker often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demand of their financial backer these attack are more likely to attempt more serious attack an example of a more serious attack wa the ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of file and denialofservice attack to carry out the full attackadditionally recent attacker motivation can be traced back to extremist organization seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agenda the growth of the internet mobile technology and inexpensive computing device have led to a rise in capability but also to the risk to environment that are deemed a vital to operation all critical targeted environment are susceptible to compromise and this ha led to a series of proactive study on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivation by these type of actor several stark difference exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actor seeking to attack based on an ideological preferencea standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system and who might be motivated to breach it the level and detail of precaution will vary depending on the system to be secured a home personal computer bank and classified military network face very different threat even when the underlying technology in use are similar computer security incident management computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack an incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such a a data breach or system failure the intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business a usual responding to compromise quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerability restore service and process and minimize loss incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practice to stop an intrusion before it cause damage typical incident response plan contain a set of written instruction that outline the organization response to a cyberattack without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholder may not understand their role process and procedure during an escalation slowing the organization response and resolution there are four key component of a computer security incident response plan preparation preparing stakeholder on the procedure for handling computer security incident or compromise detection and analysis identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident containment eradication and recovery isolating affected system to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected system and bad actor from the environment and restoring system and data when a threat no longer remains post incident activity post mortem analysis of the incident it root cause and the organization response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response effort notable attack and breach some illustrative example of different type of computer security breach are given below robert morris and the first computer worm in computer were connected to the internet and most were mainframe minicomputer and professional workstation on november many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computer the first internet computer worm the software wa traced back to cornell university graduate student robert tappan morris who said he wanted to count how many machine were connected to the internet rome laboratory in over a hundred intrusion were made by unidentified cracker into the rome laboratory the u air force main command and research facility using trojan horse hacker were able to obtain unrestricted access to rome networking system and remove trace of their activity the intruder were able to obtain classified file such a air tasking order system data and furthermore able to penetrate connected network of national aeronautics and space administration goddard space flight center wrightpatterson air force base some defense contractor and other private sector organization by posing a a trusted rome center user tjx customer credit card detail in early american apparel and home good company tjx announced that it wa the victim of an unauthorized computer system intrusion and that the hacker had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transaction stuxnet attack in the computer worm known a stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of iran nuclear centrifuge it did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controller plcs in a targeted attack this is generally believed to have been launched by israel and the united state to disrupt iran nuclear program although neither ha publicly admitted this global surveillance disclosure in early document provided by edward snowden were published by the washington post and the guardian exposing the massive scale of nsa global surveillance there were also indication that the nsa may have inserted a backdoor in a nist standard for encryption this standard wa later withdrawn due to widespread criticism the nsa additionally were revealed to have tapped the link between google data center target and home depot breach a ukrainian hacker known a rescator broke into target corporation computer in stealing roughly million credit card and then home depot computer in stealing between and million credit card number warning were delivered at both corporation but ignored physical security breach using self checkout machine are believed to have played a large role the malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting say jim walter director of threat intelligence operation at security technology company mcafee meaning that the heist could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrator responded to the warning the size of the theft ha resulted in major attention from state and federal united state authority and the investigation is ongoing office of personnel management data breach in april the office of personnel management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately million personnel record handled by the office the office of personnel management hack ha been described by federal official a among the largest breach of government data in the history of the united state data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such a social security number name date and place of birth address and fingerprint of current and

colonial pipeline ransomware attack in june the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the u and led to shortage across the east coast legal issue and global regulation international legal issue of cyber attack are complicated in nature there is no global base of common rule to judge and eventually punish cybercrime and cybercriminals and where security firm or agency do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authority can not take action due to lack of law under which to prosecute proving attribution for cybercrime and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agency computer virus switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operation like this so the internet is a if someone had given free plane ticket to all the online criminal of the world the use of technique such a dynamic dns fast flux and bullet proof server add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement role of government the role of the government is to make regulation to force company and organization to protect their system infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect it own national infrastructure such a the national powergridthe government regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated for some cyberspace wa seen a a virtual space that wa to remain free of government intervention a can be seen in many of today libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussionsmany government official and expert think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem r clarke said during a panel discussion at the rsa security conference in san francisco he belief that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation if the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through on the other hand executive from the private sector agree that improvement are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently daniel r mccarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader

click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer program that disrupt or destroy critical industry like utility transportation communication and energy such attack could also disable military network that control the movement of troop the path of jet fighter the command and control of warship this ha led to new term such a cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism the united state cyber command wa created in and many other country have similar force there are a few critical voice that question whether cybersecurity is a significant a threat a it is made out to be career cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of it concerned with reducing organization risk of hack or data breach according to research from the enterprise strategy group of organization say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skill in up from in commercial government and nongovernmental organization all employ cybersecurity professional the fastest increase in demand for

operational technology the otccf wa endorsed by the infocomm medium development authority imda it outline the different ot cybersecurity job position a well a the technical skill and core competency necessary it also depicts the many career path available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunity terminology the following term used with regard to computer security are explained below access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of user through the use of authentication system these system can protect either the whole computer such a through an interactive login screen or individual service such a a ftp server there are many method for identifying and authenticating user such a password identification card smart card and biometric system antivirus software consists of computer program that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer virus and other malicious software malware application are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block user the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignment to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing a few a possible they are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patch or update for them for example program can be installed into an individual user account which limit the program potential access a well a being a mean control which user have specific exception to policy in linux freebsd openbsd and other unixlike operating system there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other mean of restricting the application to it own sandbox for example linux provides namespaces and cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resource generalized security framework such a selinux or apparmor help administrator control access java and other language which compile to java byte code and run in the java virtual machine can have their access to other application controlled at the virtual machine level some software can be run in software container which can even provide their own set of system library limiting the software or anyone controlling it access to the server version of the library authentication technique can be used to ensure that communication endpoint are who they say they are automated theorem proving and other verification tool can be used to enable critical algorithm and code used in secure system to be mathematically proven to meet their specification backup are one or more copy kept of important computer file typically multiple copy will be kept at different location so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copy will still exist capability and access control list technique can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control capability v acls discus their use chain of trust technique can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded ha been certified a authentic by the system designer confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person cryptographic technique can be used to defend data in transit between system reducing the probability that the data exchange between system can be intercepted or modified cyberwarfare is an internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attack on information and information system such attack can for example disable official website and network disrupt or disable essential service steal or alter classified data and cripple financial system data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two update of a data recordencryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message cryptographically secure cipher are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible symmetrickey cipher are suitable for bulk encryption using shared key and publickey encryption using digital certificate can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance endpoint security software aid network in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry point made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected device such a laptop mobile device and usb drive firewall serve a a gatekeeper system between network allowing only traffic that match defined rule they often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention feature they are nearuniversal between company local area network and the internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rule between network if network segmentation is configured a hacker is someone who seek to breach defense and exploit weakness in a computer system or network honey pot are computer that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by cracker they can be used to catch cracker and to identify their technique intrusiondetection system are device or software application that monitor network or system for malicious activity or policy violation a microkernel is an approach to operating system design which ha only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and run other element of the operating system such a device driver protocol stack and file system in the safer le privileged user space pinging the standard ping application can be used to test if an ip address is in use if it is attacker may then try a port scan to detect which service are exposed a port scan is used to probe an ip address for open port to identify accessible network service and application a key logger is spyware that silently capture and store each keystroke that a user type on the computer keyboard social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individual to breach security logic bomb is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lie dormant until it is triggered by a specific event zero trust security mean that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resource on the network history since the internet arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent year the notion of cybersecurity ha become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal life cybersecurity and cyber threat have been consistently present for the last year of technological change in the and computer security wa mainly limited to academia until the conception of the internet where with increased connectivity computer virus and network intrusion began to take off after the spread of virus in the the marked the institutionalization of organized attack such a distributed denial of service this led to the formalization of cybersecurity a a professional disciplinethe april session organized by willis ware at the spring joint computer conference and the later publication of the ware report were foundational moment in the history of the field of computer security ware work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concernsa nist publication introduced the cia triad of confidentiality integrity and availability a a clear and simple way to describe key security goal while still relevant many more elaborate framework have since been proposedhowever in the and there were no grave computer threat because computer and the internet were still developing and security threat were easily identifiable more often threat came from malicious insider who gained unauthorized access to sensitive document and file although malware and network breach existed during the early year they did not use them for financial gain by the second half of the established computer firm like ibm started offering commercial access control system and computer security software productsone of the earliest example of an attack on a computer network wa the computer worm creeper written by bob thomas at bbn which propagated through the arpanet in the program wa purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload a later program reaper wa created by ray tomlinson in and used to destroy creeperbetween september and june a group of german hacker performed the first documented case of cyber espionage the group hacked into american defense contractor university and military base network and sold gathered information to the soviet kgb the group wa led by markus hess who wa arrested on june he wa convicted of espionage along with two coconspirator on feb in one of the first computer worm called the morris worm wa distributed via the internet it gained significant mainstream medium attentionin netscape started developing the protocol ssl shortly after the national center for supercomputing application ncsa launched mosaic the first web browser in netscape had ssl version ready in but it wa never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerability these weakness included replay attack and a vulnerability that allowed hacker to alter unencrypted communication sent by user however in february netscape launched version national security agency nsa is responsible for the protection of u information system and also for collecting foreign intelligence the agency analyzes commonly used software and system configuration to find security flaw which it can use for offensive purpose against competitor of the united statesnsa contractor created and sold clickandshoot attack tool to u agency and close ally but eventually the tool made their way to foreign adversary in nsa own hacking tool were hacked and they have been used by russia and north korea nsa employee and contractor have been recruited at high salary by adversary anxious to compete in cyberwarfare in the united state and israel began exploiting security flaw in the microsoft window operating system to attack and damage equipment used in iran to refine nuclear material iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability which it began using against the united state notable scholar see also reference

device due to the limited display of url in mobile browser smishing can be just a effective a email phishing a many smartphones have fast internet connectivity smishing message may also come from unusual phone number page hijacking page hijacking involves redirecting user to malicious website or exploit kit through the compromise of legitimate web page often using cross site scripting hacker may insert exploit kit such a mpack into compromised website to exploit legitimate user visiting the server page hijacking can also involve the insertion of malicious inline frame allowing exploit kit

for a link appear trustworthy while the actual link go to the phishers site to check the destination of a link many email client and web browser will show the url in the status bar when the mouse is hovering over it however some phishers may be able to bypass this security measureinternationalized domain name idns can be exploited via idn spoofing or homograph attack to allow attacker to create fake website with visually identical address to legitimate one these attack have been used by phishers to disguise malicious url using open url redirectors on trusted website even digital certificate such a ssl may not protect against these attack a phishers can purchase valid certificate and alter content to mimic genuine website or host phishing site without ssl filter evasion phishers have

attachment or revealing sensitive information it often involves pretending to be a trusted entity and creating a sense of urgency like threatening to close or seize a victim bank or insurance accountan alternative technique to impersonationbased phishing is the use of fake news article to trick victim into clicking on a malicious link these link often lead to fake website that appear legitimate but are actually run by attacker who may try to install malware or present fake virus notification to the victim history early history early phishing technique can be traced back to the when black hat hacker and the warez community used aol to steal credit card information and commit other online crime the term phishing is said to have been coined by khan c smith a wellknown spammer and hacker and it first recorded mention wa found in the hacking tool aohell which wa released in aohell allowed hacker to impersonate aol staff and send instant message to victim asking them to reveal their password in response aol implemented measure to prevent phishing and eventually shut down the warez scene on their platform in the phishing attack became more organized and targeted the first known direct attempt against a payment system egold occurred in june and shortly after the september attack a id check phishing attack followed the first known phishing attack against a retail

antiphishing there are antiphishing website which publish exact message that have been recently circulating the internet such a fraudwatch international and millersmiles such site often provide specific detail about the particular messagesas recently a the adoption of antiphishing strategy by business needing to protect personal and financial information wa low now there are several different technique to combat phishing including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing these technique include step that can be taken by individual a well a by organization phone web site and email phishing can now be reported to authority a described below user training effective phishing education including conceptual knowledge and feedback is an important part of any organization antiphishing strategy while there is limited data on the effectiveness of education in reducing susceptibility to phishing much information on the threat is available onlinesimulated phishing campaign in which organization test their employee training by sending fake phishing email are commonly used to ass their effectiveness one example is a study by the national library of medicine in which an organization received email during a testing period with being marketing and being identified a potential threat these campaign are often used in the healthcare industry a healthcare data is a valuable target for hacker these campaign are just one of the way that organization are working to combat phishingto avoid phishing attempt people can modify their browsing habit and be cautious of email claiming to be from a company asking to verify an account it best to contact the company directly or manually type in their website address rather than clicking on any hyperlink in suspicious emailsnearly all legitimate email message from company to their customer contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers some company for example paypal always address their customer by their username in email so if an email address the recipient in a generic fashion dear paypal customer it is likely to be an attempt at phishing furthermore paypal offer various method to determine spoof email and advises user to forward suspicious email to their spoofpaypalcom domain to investigate and warn other customer however it is unsafe to assume that the presence of personal information alone guarantee that a message is legitimate and some study have shown that the presence of personal information doe not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attack which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such detail email from bank and credit card company often include partial account number but research ha shown that people tend to not differentiate between the first and last digit this is an issue because the first few digit are often the same for all client of a financial institution a study on phishing attack in game environment found that educational game can effectively educate player against information disclosure and can increase awareness on phishing risk thus mitigating risk this an example of how user can be trained through game based model the antiphishing working group who one of the largest antiphishing organization in the world produce regular report on trend in phishing attacksgoogle posted a video demonstrating how to identify and protect yourself from phishing scam technical approach a wide range of technical approach are available to prevent phishing attack reaching user or to prevent them from successfully capturing sensitive information filtering out phishing mail specialized spam filter can reduce the number of phishing email that reach their addressee inboxes these filter use a number of technique including machine learning and natural language processing approach to classify phishing email and reject email with forged address browser alerting user to fraudulent website another popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain a list of known phishing site and to check website against the list one such service is the safe browsing service web browser such a google chrome internet explorer mozilla firefox safari and opera all contain this type of antiphishing measure firefox used google antiphishing software opera us live blacklist from phishtank cyscon and geotrust a well a live whitelists from geotrust some implementation of this approach send the visited url to a central service to be checked which ha raised concern about privacy according to a report by mozilla in late firefox wa found to be more effective than internet explorer at detecting fraudulent site in a study by an independent software testing companyan approach introduced in involves switching to a special dns service that filter out known phishing domain this will work with any browser and is similar in principle to using a host file to block web advert to mitigate the problem of phishing site impersonating a victim site by embedding it image such a logo several site owner have altered the image to send a message to the visitor that a site may be fraudulent the image may be moved to a new filename and the original permanently replaced or a server can detect that the image wa not requested a part of normal browsing and instead send a warning image augmenting password logins the bank of america website is one of several that asks user to select a personal image marketed a sitekey and display this userselected image with any form that request a password user of the bank online service are instructed to enter a password only when they see the image they selected however several study suggest that few user refrain from entering their password when image are absent in addition this feature like other form of twofactor authentication is susceptible to other attack such a those suffered by scandinavian bank nordea in late and citibank in similar system in which an automatically generated identity cue consisting of a colored word within a colored box is displayed to each website user is in use at other financial institutionssecurity skin are a related technique that involves overlaying a userselected image onto the login form a a visual cue that the form is legitimate unlike the websitebased image scheme however the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser and not between the user and the website the scheme also relies on a mutual authentication protocol which make it le vulnerable to attack that affect useronly authentication scheme still another technique relies on a dynamic grid of image that is different for each login attempt the user must identify the picture that fit their prechosen category such a dog car and flower only after they have correctly identified the picture that fit their category are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login unlike the static image used on the bank of america website a dynamic imagebased authentication method creates a onetime passcode for the login requires active participation from the user and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated image that includes the user secret category monitoring and takedown several company offer bank and other organization likely to suffer from phishing scam roundtheclock service to monitor analyze and assist in shutting down phishing website automated detection of phishing content is still below accepted level for direct action with contentbased analysis reaching between and of success so most of the tool include manual step to certify the detection and authorize the response individual can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry group such a cyscon or phishtank phishing web page and email can be reported to google transaction verification and signing solution have also emerged using the mobile phone smartphone a a second channel for verification and authorization of banking transaction multifactor authentication organization can implement two factor or multifactor authentication mfa which requires a user to use at least factor when logging in for example a user must both present a smart card and a password this mitigates some risk in the event of a successful phishing attack the stolen password on it own can not be reused to further breach the protected system however there are several attack method which can defeat many of the typical system mfa scheme such a webauthn address this issue by design email content redaction organization that prioritize security over convenience can require user of it computer to use an email client that redact url from email message thus making it impossible for the reader of the email to click on a link or even copy a url while this may result in an inconvenience it doe almost eliminate email phishing attack limitation of technical response an article in forbes in august argues that the reason phishing problem persist even after a decade of antiphishing technology being sold is that phishing is a technological medium to exploit human weakness and that technology can not fully compensate for human weaknessesorganizational response scholar have found that the investment into both technological and organizational factor can impact protection against phishing the study found that organization can improve their technical education of employee if they include sociotechnical factor in their

Computer Virus,a comput viru is a type of malwar that when execut replic itself by modifi other comput program and insert it own code into those program if thi replic succe the affect area are then said to be infect with a comput viru a metaphor deriv from biolog virusescomput virus gener requir a host program the viru write it own code into the host program when the program run the written viru program is execut first caus infect and damag by contrast a comput worm doe not need a host program as it is an independ program or code chunk therefor it is not restrict by the host program but can run independ and activ carri out attacksviru writer use social engin decept and exploit detail knowledg of secur vulner to initi infect system and to spread the viru virus use complex antidetectionstealth strategi to evad antiviru softwar motiv for creat virus can includ seek profit eg with ransomwar desir to send a polit messag person amus to demonstr that a vulner exist in

window and window hostseven home comput were affect by virus the first one to appear on the amiga wa a boot sector viru call sca viru which wa detect in novemb design part a comput viru gener contain three part the infect mechan which find and infect new file the payload which is the malici code to execut and the trigger which determin when to activ the payload infect mechan also call the infect vector thi is how the viru spread some virus have a search routin which locat and infect file on disk other virus infect file as they are run such as the jerusalem do viru trigger also known as a logic bomb thi is the part of the viru that determin the condit for which the payload is activ thi condit may be a particular date time presenc of anoth program size on disk exceed a threshold or open a specif file payload the payload is the bodi of the viru that execut the malici activ exampl of malici activ includ damag file theft of confidenti inform or spi on the infect system payload activ is sometim notic as it can caus the system to slow down or freez sometim payload are nondestruct and their main purpos is to spread a messag to as mani peopl as possibl thi is call a viru hoax phase viru phase is the life cycl of the comput viru describ by use an analog to biolog thi life cycl can be divid into four phase dormant phase the viru program is idl dure thi stage the viru program ha manag to access the target user comput or softwar but dure thi stage the viru doe not take ani action the viru will eventu be activ by the trigger which state which event will execut the viru not all virus have thi stage propag phase the viru start propag which is multipli and replic itself the viru place a copi of itself into other program or into certain system area on the disk the copi may not be ident to the propag version virus often morph or chang to evad detect by it profession and antiviru softwar each infect program will now contain a clone of the viru which will itself enter a propag phase trigger phase a dormant viru move into thi phase when it is activ and will now perform the function for which it wa intend the trigger phase can be caus by a varieti of system event includ a count of the number of time that thi copi of the viru ha made copi of itself the trigger may occur when an employe is termin from their employ or after a set period of time ha elaps in order to reduc suspicion execut phase thi is the actual work of the viru where the payload will be releas it can be destruct such as delet file on disk crash the system or corrupt file or rel harmless such as pop up humor or polit messag on screen target and replic comput virus infect a varieti of differ subsystem on their host comput and softwar one manner of classifi virus is to analyz whether they resid in binari execut such as exe or com file data file such as microsoft word document or pdf file or in the boot sector of the host hard drive or some combin of all of thesea memoryresid viru or simpli resid viru instal itself as part of the oper system when execut after which it remain in ram from the time the comput is boot up to when it is shut down resid virus overwrit interrupt handl code or other function and when the oper system attempt to access the target file or disk sector the viru code intercept the request and redirect the control flow to the replic modul infect the target in contrast a nonmemoryresid viru or nonresid viru when execut scan the disk for target infect them and then exit ie it doe not remain in memori after it is done executingmani common applic such as microsoft outlook and microsoft word allow macro program to be embed in document or email so that the program may be run automat when the document is open a macro viru or document viru is a viru that is written in a macro languag and embed into these document so that when user open the file the viru code is execut and can infect the user comput thi is one of the reason that it is danger to open unexpect or suspici attach in email while not open attach in email from unknown person or organ can help to reduc the likelihood of contract a viru in some case the viru is design so that the email appear to be from a reput organ eg a major bank or credit card compani boot sector virus specif target the boot sector andor the master boot record mbr of the host hard disk drive solidst drive or remov storag media flash drive floppi disk etcth most common way of transmiss of comput virus in boot sector is physic media when read the vbr of the drive the infect floppi disk or usb flash drive connect to the comput will transfer data and then modifi or replac the exist boot code the next time a user tri to start the desktop the viru will immedi load and run as part of the master boot recordemail virus are virus that intent rather than accident use the email system to spread while viru infect file may be accident sent as email attach email virus are awar of email system function they gener target a specif type of email system microsoft outlook is the most commonli use harvest email address from variou sourc and may append copi of themselv to all email sent or may gener email messag contain copi of themselv as attach detect to avoid detect by user some virus employ differ kind of decept some old virus especi on the do platform make sure that the last modifi date of a host file stay the same when the file is infect by the viru thi approach doe not fool antiviru softwar howev especi those which maintain and date cyclic redund check on file chang some virus can infect file without increas their size or damag the file they accomplish thi by overwrit unus area of execut file these are call caviti virus for exampl the cih viru or chernobyl viru infect portabl execut file becaus those file have mani empti gap the viru which wa kb in length did not add to the size of the file some virus tri to avoid detect by kill the task associ with antiviru softwar befor it can detect them for exampl confick a viru may also hide it presenc use a rootkit by not show itself on the list of system process or by disguis itself within a trust process in the as comput and oper system grow larger and more complex old hide techniqu need to be updat or replac defend a comput against virus may demand that a file system migrat toward detail and explicit permiss for everi kind of file access in addit onli a small fraction of known virus actual caus real incid primarili becaus mani virus remain below the theoret epidem threshold read request intercept while some kind of antiviru softwar employ variou techniqu to counter stealth mechan onc the infect occur ani recours to clean the system is unreli in microsoft window oper system the ntf file system is proprietari thi leav antiviru softwar littl altern but to send a read request to window file that handl such request some virus trick antiviru softwar by intercept it request to the oper system a viru can hide by intercept the request to read the infect file handl the request itself and return an uninfect version of the file to the antiviru softwar the intercept can occur by code inject of the actual oper system file that would handl the read request thu an antiviru softwar attempt to detect the viru will either not be permit to read the infect file or the read request will be serv with the uninfect version of the same fileth onli reliabl method to avoid stealth virus is to boot from a medium that is known to be clear secur softwar can then be use to check the dormant oper system file most secur softwar reli on viru signatur or they employ heurist secur softwar may also use a databas of file hash for window os file so the secur softwar can identifi alter file and request window instal media to replac them with authent version in older version of window file cryptograph hash function of window os file store in windowsto allow file integrityauthent to be checkedcould be overwritten so that the system file checker would report that alter system file are authent so use file hash to scan for alter file would not alway guarante find an infect selfmodif most modern antiviru program tri to find viruspattern insid ordinari program by scan them for socal viru signatur differ antiviru program will employ differ search method when identifi virus if a viru scanner find such a pattern in a file it will perform other check to make sure that it ha found the viru and not mere a coincident sequenc in an innoc file befor it notifi the user that the file is infect the user can then delet or in some case clean or heal the infect file some virus employ techniqu that make detect by mean of signatur difficult but probabl not imposs these virus modifi their code on each infect that is each infect file contain a differ variant of the viruson method of evad signatur detect is to use simpl encrypt to enciph encod the bodi of the viru leav onli the encrypt modul and a static cryptograph key in cleartext which doe not chang from one infect to the next in thi case the viru consist of a small decrypt modul and an encrypt copi of the viru code if the viru is encrypt with a differ key for each infect file the onli part of the viru that remain constant is the decrypt modul which would for exampl be append to the end in thi case a viru scanner can not directli detect the viru use signatur but it can still detect the decrypt modul which still make indirect detect of the viru possibl sinc these would be symmetr key store on the infect host it is entir possibl to decrypt the final viru but thi is probabl not requir sinc selfmodifi code is such a rariti that find some may be reason enough for viru scanner to at least flag the file as suspici an old but compact way will be the use of arithmet oper like addit or subtract and the use of logic condit such as xore where each byte in a viru is with a constant so that the exclusiveor oper had onli to be repeat for decrypt it is suspici for a code to modifi itself so the code to do the encryptiondecrypt may be part of the signatur in mani viru definit a simpler older approach did not use a key where the encrypt consist onli of oper with no paramet like increment and decrement bitwis rotat arithmet negat and logic not some virus call polymorph virus will employ a mean of encrypt insid an execut in which the viru is encrypt under certain event such as the viru scanner be disabl for updat or the comput be reboot thi is call cryptovirolog polymorph code wa the first techniqu that pose a seriou threat to viru scanner just like regular encrypt virus a polymorph viru infect file with an encrypt copi of itself which is decod by a decrypt modul in the case of polymorph virus howev thi decrypt modul is also modifi on each infect a wellwritten polymorph viru therefor ha no part which remain ident between infect make it veri difficult to detect directli use signatur antiviru softwar can detect it by decrypt the virus use an emul or by statist pattern analysi of the encrypt viru bodi to enabl polymorph code the viru ha to have a polymorph engin also call mutat engin or mutat engin somewher in it encrypt bodi see polymorph code for technic detail on how such engin operatesom virus employ polymorph code in a way that constrain the mutat rate of the viru significantli for exampl a viru can be program to mutat onli slightli over time or it can be program to refrain from mutat when it infect a file on a comput that alreadi contain copi of the viru the advantag of use such slow polymorph code is that it make it more difficult for antiviru profession and investig to obtain repres sampl of the viru becaus bait file that are infect in one run will typic contain ident or similar sampl of the viru thi will make it more like that the detect by the viru scanner will be unreli and that some instanc of the viru may be abl to avoid detect to avoid be detect by emul some virus rewrit themselv complet each time they are to infect new execut virus that util thi techniqu are said to be in metamorph code to enabl metamorph a metamorph engin is need a metamorph viru is usual veri larg and complex for exampl consist of over line of assembl languag code of which is part of the metamorph engin effect damag is due to caus system failur corrupt data wast comput resourc increas mainten cost or steal person inform even though no antiviru softwar can uncov all comput virus especi new one comput secur research are activ search for new way to enabl antiviru solut to more effect detect emerg virus befor they becom wide distributeda power viru is a comput program that execut specif machin code to reach the maximum cpu power dissip thermal energi output for the central process unit comput cool apparatu are design to dissip power up to the thermal design power rather than maximum power and a power viru could caus the system to overheat if it doe not have logic to stop the processor thi may caus perman physic damag power virus can be malici but are often suit of test softwar use for integr test and thermal test of comput compon dure the design phase of a product or for product benchmarkingst test applic are similar program which have the same effect as power virus high cpu usag but stay under the user control they are use for test cpu for exampl when overclock spinlock in a poorli written program may caus similar symptom if it last suffici long differ microarchitectur typic requir differ machin code to hit their maximum power exampl of such machin code do not appear to be distribut in cpu refer materi infect vector as softwar is often design with secur featur to prevent unauthor use of system resourc mani virus must exploit and manipul secur bug which are secur defect in a system or applic softwar to spread themselv and infect other comput softwar develop strategi that produc larg number of bug will gener also produc potenti exploit hole or entranc for the viru to replic itself a viru must be permit to execut code and write to memori for thi reason mani virus attach themselv to execut file that may be part of legitim program see code inject if a user attempt to launch an infect program the viru code may be execut simultan in oper system that use file extens to determin program associ such as microsoft window the extens may be hidden from the user by default thi make it possibl to creat a file that is of a differ type than it appear to the user for exampl an execut may be creat and name picturepngex in which the user see onli picturepng and therefor assum that thi file is a digit imag and most like is safe yet when open it run the execut on the client machin virus may be instal on remov media such as flash drive the drive may be left in a park lot of a govern build or other target with the hope that curiou user will insert the drive into a comput in a experi research at the univers of michigan found that percent of user would plug in a flash drive of unknown originth vast major of virus target system run microsoft window thi is due to microsoft larg market share of desktop comput user the divers of softwar system on a network limit the destruct potenti of virus and malwar opensourc oper system such as linux allow user to choos from a varieti of desktop environ packag tool etc which mean that malici code target ani of these system will onli affect a subset of all user mani window user are run the same set of applic enabl virus to rapidli spread among microsoft window system by target the same exploit on larg number of hostswhil linux and unix in gener have alway nativ prevent normal user from make chang to the oper system environ without permiss window user are gener not prevent from make these chang mean that virus can easili gain control of the entir system on window host thi differ ha continu partli due to the widespread use of administr account in contemporari version like window xp in research creat and releas a viru for linuxknown as bliss bliss howev requir that the user run it explicitli and it can onli infect program that the user ha the access to modifi unlik window user most unix user do

and that have been confirm as host malwar by googlether are two common method that an antiviru softwar applic use to detect virus as describ in the antiviru softwar articl the first and by far the most common method of viru detect is use a list of viru signatur definit thi work by examin the content of the comput memori it random access memori ram and boot sector and the file store on fix or remov drive hard drive floppi drive or usb flash drive and compar those file against a databas of known viru signatur viru signatur are just string of code that are use to identifi individu virus for each viru the antiviru design tri to choos a uniqu signatur string that will not be found in a legitim program differ antiviru program use differ signatur to identifi virus the disadvantag of thi detect method is that user are onli protect from virus that are detect by signatur in their most recent viru definit updat and not protect from new virus see zeroday attacka second method to find virus is to use a heurist algorithm base on common viru behavior thi method can detect new virus for which antiviru secur firm have yet to defin a signatur but it also give rise to more fals posit than use signatur fals posit can be disrupt especi in a commerci environ becaus it may lead to a compani instruct staff not to use the compani comput system until it servic have check the system for

program and inserting it own code into those program if this replication succeeds the affected area are then said to be infected with a computer virus a metaphor derived from biological virusescomputer virus generally require a host program the virus writes it own code into the host program when the program run the written virus program is executed first causing infection and damage by contrast a computer worm doe not need a host program a it is an independent program or code chunk therefore it is not restricted by the host program but can run independently and actively carry out attacksvirus writer use social engineering deception and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerability to initially infect system and to spread the virus virus use complex antidetectionstealth strategy to evade antivirus software motif for creating virus can include seeking profit eg with ransomware desire to send a political message personal amusement to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software for sabotage and denial of service or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issue artificial life and evolutionary algorithmsas of computer virus caused billion of dollar worth of economic damage each year in response an industry of antivirus software ha cropped up selling or freely distributing virus protection to user of various operating system history the first academic work on the theory of selfreplicating computer program wa done in by john von neumann who gave lecture at the university of illinois about the theory and organization of complicated automaton the work of von neumann wa later published a the theory of selfreproducing automaton in his essay von neumann described how a computer program could be designed to reproduce itself von neumann design for a selfreproducing computer program is considered the world first computer virus and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology in veith risak directly building on von neumann work on selfreplication published his article selbstreproduzierende automaten mit minimaler informationsbertragung selfreproducing automaton with minimal information exchange the article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a siemens computer system in jrgen kraus wrote his diplom thesis selbstreproduktion bei programmen selfreproduction of program at the university of dortmund in his work kraus postulated that computer program can behave in a way similar to biological virus the creeper virus wa first detected on arpanet the forerunner of the internet in the early creeper wa an experimental selfreplicating program written by bob thomas at bbn technology in creeper used the arpanet to infect dec computer running the tenex operating system creeper gained access via the arpanet and copied itself to the remote system where the message im the creeper catch me if you can wa displayed the reaper program wa created to delete creeperin a program called elk cloner wa the first personal computer virus to appear in the wildthat is outside the single computer or computer lab where it wa created written in by richard skrenta a ninth grader at mount lebanon high school near pittsburgh it attached itself to the apple do operating system and spread via floppy disk on it use the elk cloner virus would be activated infecting the personal computer and displaying a short poem beginning elk cloner the program with a personality in fred cohen from the university of southern california wrote his paper computer virus theory and experiment it wa the first paper to explicitly call a selfreproducing program a virus a term introduced by cohens mentor leonard adleman in fred cohen published a demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible virus fred cohens theoretical compression virus wa an example of a virus which wa not malicious software malware but wa putatively benevolent wellintentioned however antivirus professional do not accept the concept of benevolent virus a any desired function can be implemented without involving a virus automatic compression for instance is available under window at the choice of the user any virus will by definition make unauthorised change to a computer which is undesirable even if no damage is done or intended the first page of dr solomon virus encyclopaedia explains the undesirability of virus even those that do nothing but reproducean article that describes useful virus functionality wa published by j b gunn under the title use of virus function to provide a virtual apl interpreter under user control in the first ibm pc compatible virus in the wild wa a boot sector virus dubbed cbrain created in and wa released in by amjad farooq alvi and basit farooq alvi in lahore pakistan reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written the first virus to specifically target microsoft window winvir wa discovered in april two year after the release of window the virus did not contain any window api call instead relying on do interrupt a few year later in february australian hacker from the viruswriting crew vlad created the bizatch virus also known a boza virus which wa the first known virus to target window in late the encrypted memoryresident stealth virus wa releasedthe first known virus that targeted window nt it wa also able to infect window and window hostseven home computer were affected by virus the first one to appear on the amiga wa a boot sector virus called sca virus which wa detected in november design part a computer virus generally contains three part the infection mechanism which find and infects new file the payload which is the malicious code to execute and the trigger which determines when to activate the payload infection mechanism also called the infection vector this is how the virus spread some virus have a search routine which locate and infect file on disk other virus infect file a they are run such a the jerusalem do virus trigger also known a a logic bomb this is the part of the virus that determines the condition for which the payload is activated this condition may be a particular date time presence of another program size on disk exceeding a threshold or opening a specific file payload the payload is the body of the virus that executes the malicious activity example of malicious activity include damaging file theft of confidential information or spying on the infected system payload activity is sometimes noticeable a it can cause the system to slow down or freeze sometimes payload are nondestructive and their main purpose is to spread a message to a many people a possible this is called a virus hoax phase virus phase is the life cycle of the computer virus described by using an analogy to biology this life cycle can be divided into four phase dormant phase the virus program is idle during this stage the virus program ha managed to access the target user computer or software but during this stage the virus doe not take any action the virus will eventually be activated by the trigger which state which event will execute the virus not all virus have this stage propagation phase the virus start propagating which is multiplying and replicating itself the virus place a copy of itself into other program or into certain system area on the disk the copy may not be identical to the propagating version virus often morph or change to evade detection by it professional and antivirus software each infected program will now contain a clone of the virus which will itself enter a propagation phase triggering phase a dormant virus move into this phase when it is activated and will now perform the function for which it wa intended the triggering phase can be caused by a variety of system event including a count of the number of time that this copy of the virus ha made copy of itself the trigger may occur when an employee is terminated from their employment or after a set period of time ha elapsed in order to reduce suspicion execution phase this is the actual work of the virus where the payload will be released it can be destructive such a deleting file on disk crashing the system or corrupting file or relatively harmless such a popping up humorous or political message on screen target and replication computer virus infect a variety of different subsystem on their host computer and software one manner of classifying virus is to analyze whether they reside in binary executables such a exe or com file data file such a microsoft word document or pdf file or in the boot sector of the host hard drive or some combination of all of thesea memoryresident virus or simply resident virus installs itself a part of the operating system when executed after which it remains in ram from the time the computer is booted up to when it is shut down resident virus overwrite interrupt handling code or other function and when the operating system attempt to access the target file or disk sector the virus code intercept the request and redirects the control flow to the replication module infecting the target in contrast a nonmemoryresident virus or nonresident virus when executed scan the disk for target infects them and then exit ie it doe not remain in memory after it is done executingmany common application such a microsoft outlook and microsoft word allow macro program to be embedded in document or email so that the program may be run automatically when the document is opened a macro virus or document virus is a virus that is written in a macro language and embedded into these document so that when user open the file the virus code is executed and can infect the user computer this is one of the reason that it is dangerous to open unexpected or suspicious attachment in email while not opening attachment in email from unknown person or organization can help to reduce the likelihood of contracting a virus in some case the virus is designed so that the email appears to be from a reputable organization eg a major bank or credit card company boot sector virus specifically target the boot sector andor the master boot record mbr of the host hard disk drive solidstate drive or removable storage medium flash drive floppy disk etcthe most common way of transmission of computer virus in boot sector is physical medium when reading the vbr of the drive the infected floppy disk or usb flash drive connected to the computer will transfer data and then modify or replace the existing boot code the next time a user try to start the desktop the virus will immediately load and run a part of the master boot recordemail virus are virus that intentionally rather than accidentally use the email system to spread while virus infected file may be accidentally sent a email attachment email virus are aware of email system function they generally target a specific type of email system microsoft outlook is the most commonly used harvest email address from various source and may append copy of themselves to all email sent or may generate email message containing copy of themselves a attachment detection to avoid detection by user some virus employ different kind of deception some old virus especially on the do platform make sure that the last modified date of a host file stay the same when the file is infected by the virus this approach doe not fool antivirus software however especially those which maintain and date cyclic redundancy check on file change some virus can infect file without increasing their size or damaging the file they accomplish this by overwriting unused area of executable file these are called cavity virus for example the cih virus or chernobyl virus infects portable executable file because those file have many empty gap the virus which wa kb in length did not add to the size of the file some virus try to avoid detection by killing the task associated with antivirus software before it can detect them for example conficker a virus may also hide it presence using a rootkit by not showing itself on the list of system process or by disguising itself within a trusted process in the a computer and operating system grow larger and more complex old hiding technique need to be updated or replaced defending a computer against virus may demand that a file system migrate towards detailed and explicit permission for every kind of file access in addition only a small fraction of known virus actually cause real incident primarily because many virus remain below the theoretical epidemic threshold read request intercept while some kind of antivirus software employ various technique to counter stealth mechanism once the infection occurs any recourse to clean the system is unreliable in microsoft window operating system the ntfs file system is proprietary this leaf antivirus software little alternative but to send a read request to window file that handle such request some virus trick antivirus software by intercepting it request to the operating system a virus can hide by intercepting the request to read the infected file handling the request itself and returning an uninfected version of the file to the antivirus software the interception can occur by code injection of the actual operating system file that would handle the read request thus an antivirus software attempting to detect the virus will either not be permitted to read the infected file or the read request will be served with the uninfected version of the same filethe only reliable method to avoid stealth virus is to boot from a medium that is known to be clear security software can then be used to check the dormant operating system file most security software relies on virus signature or they employ heuristic security software may also use a database of file hash for window o file so the security software can identify altered file and request window installation medium to replace them with authentic version in older version of window file cryptographic hash function of window o file stored in windowsto allow file integrityauthenticity to be checkedcould be overwritten so that the system file checker would report that altered system file are authentic so using file hash to scan for altered file would not always guarantee finding an infection selfmodification most modern antivirus program try to find viruspatterns inside ordinary program by scanning them for socalled virus signature different antivirus program will employ different search method when identifying virus if a virus scanner find such a pattern in a file it will perform other check to make sure that it ha found the virus and not merely a coincidental sequence in an innocent file before it notifies the user that the file is infected the user can then delete or in some case clean or heal the infected file some virus employ technique that make detection by mean of signature difficult but probably not impossible these virus modify their code on each infection that is each infected file contains a different variant of the virusone method of evading signature detection is to use simple encryption to encipher encode the body of the virus leaving only the encryption module and a static cryptographic key in cleartext which doe not change from one infection to the next in this case the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus code if the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file the only part of the virus that remains constant is the decrypting module which would for example be appended to the end in this case a virus scanner can not directly detect the virus using signature but it can still detect the decrypting module which still make indirect detection of the virus possible since these would be symmetric key stored on the infected host it is entirely possible to decrypt the final virus but this is probably not required since selfmodifying code is such a rarity that finding some may be reason enough for virus scanner to at least flag the file a suspicious an old but compact way will be the use of arithmetic operation like addition or subtraction and the use of logical condition such a xoring where each byte in a virus is with a constant so that the exclusiveor operation had only to be repeated for decryption it is suspicious for a code to modify itself so the code to do the encryptiondecryption may be part of the signature in many virus definition a simpler older approach did not use a key where the encryption consisted only of operation with no parameter like incrementing and decrementing bitwise rotation arithmetic negation and logical not some virus called polymorphic virus will employ a mean of encryption inside an executable in which the virus is encrypted under certain event such a the virus scanner being disabled for update or the computer being rebooted this is called cryptovirology polymorphic code wa the first technique that posed a serious threat to virus scanner just like regular encrypted virus a polymorphic virus infects file with an encrypted copy of itself which is decoded by a decryption module in the case of polymorphic virus however this decryption module is also modified on each infection a wellwritten polymorphic virus therefore ha no part which remain identical between infection making it very difficult to detect directly using signature antivirus software can detect it by decrypting the virus using an emulator or by statistical pattern analysis of the encrypted virus body to enable polymorphic code the virus ha to have a polymorphic engine also called mutating engine or mutation engine somewhere in it encrypted body see polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engine operatesome virus employ polymorphic code in a way that constrains the mutation rate of the virus significantly for example a virus can be programmed to mutate only slightly over time or it can be programmed to refrain from mutating when it infects a file on a computer that already contains copy of the virus the advantage of using such slow polymorphic code is that it make it more difficult for antivirus professional and investigator to obtain representative sample of the virus because bait file that are infected in one run will typically contain identical or similar sample of the virus this will make it more likely that the detection by the virus scanner will be unreliable and that some instance of the virus may be able to avoid detection to avoid being detected by emulation some virus rewrite themselves completely each time they are to infect new executables virus that utilize this technique are said to be in metamorphic code to enable metamorphism a metamorphic engine is needed a metamorphic virus is usually very large and complex for example consisted of over line of assembly language code of which is part of the metamorphic engine effect damage is due to causing system failure corrupting data wasting computer resource increasing maintenance cost or stealing personal information even though no antivirus software can uncover all computer virus especially new one computer security researcher are actively searching for new way to enable antivirus solution to more effectively detect emerging virus before they become widely distributeda power virus is a computer program that executes specific machine code to reach the maximum cpu power dissipation thermal energy output for the central processing unit computer cooling apparatus are designed to dissipate power up to the thermal design power rather than maximum power and a power virus could cause the system to overheat if it doe not have logic to stop the processor this may cause permanent physical damage power virus can be malicious but are often suite of test software used for integration testing and thermal testing of computer component during the design phase of a product or for product benchmarkingstability test application are similar program which have the same effect a power virus high cpu usage but stay under the user control they are used for testing cpu for example when overclocking spinlock in a poorly written program may cause similar symptom if it last sufficiently long different microarchitectures typically require different machine code to hit their maximum power example of such machine code do not appear to be distributed in cpu reference material infection vector a software is often designed with security feature to prevent unauthorized use of system resource many virus must exploit and manipulate security bug which are security defect in a system or application software to spread themselves and infect other computer software development strategy that produce large number of bug will generally also produce potential exploitable hole or entrance for the virus to replicate itself a virus must be permitted to execute code and write to memory for this reason many virus attach themselves to executable file that may be part of legitimate program see code injection if a user attempt to launch an infected program the virus code may be executed simultaneously in operating system that use file extension to determine program association such a microsoft window the extension may be hidden from the user by default this make it possible to create a file that is of a different type than it appears to the user for example an executable may be created and named picturepngexe in which the user see only picturepng and therefore assumes that this file is a digital image and most likely is safe yet when opened it run the executable on the client machine virus may be installed on removable medium such a flash drive the drive may be left in a parking lot of a government building or other target with the hope that curious user will insert the drive into a computer in a experiment researcher at the university of michigan found that percent of user would plug in a flash drive of unknown originthe vast majority of virus target system running microsoft window this is due to microsofts large market share of desktop computer user the diversity of software system on a network limit the destructive potential of virus and malware opensource operating system such a linux allow user to choose from a variety of desktop environment packaging tool etc which mean that malicious code targeting any of these system will only affect a subset of all user many window user are running the same set of application enabling virus to rapidly spread among microsoft window system by targeting the same exploit on large number of hostswhile linux and unix in general have always natively prevented normal user from making change to the operating system environment without permission window user are generally not prevented from making these change meaning that virus can easily gain control of the entire system on window host this difference ha continued partly due to the widespread use of administrator account in contemporary version like window xp in researcher created and released a virus for linuxknown a bliss bliss however requires that the user run it explicitly and it can only infect program that the user ha the access to modify unlike window user most unix user do not log in a an administrator or root user except to install or configure software a a result even if a user ran the virus it could not harm their operating system the bliss virus never became widespread and remains chiefly a research curiosity it creator later posted the source code to usenet allowing researcher to see how it workedbefore computer network became widespread most virus spread on removable medium particularly floppy disk in the early day of the personal computer many user regularly exchanged information and program on floppy some virus spread by infecting program stored on these disk while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector ensuring that they would be run when the user booted the computer from the disk usually inadvertently personal computer of the era would attempt to boot first from a floppy if one had been left in the drive until floppy disk fell out of use this wa the most successful infection strategy and boot sector virus were the most common in the wild for many year traditional computer virus emerged in the driven by the spread of personal computer and the resultant increase in bulletin board system bb modem use and software sharing bulletin boarddriven software sharing contributed directly to the spread of trojan horse program and virus were written to infect popularly traded software shareware and bootleg software were equally common vector for virus on bbs virus can increase their chance of spreading to other computer by infecting file on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by other computersmacro virus have become common since the most of these virus are written in the scripting language for microsoft program such a microsoft word and microsoft excel and spread throughout microsoft office by infecting document and spreadsheet since word and excel were also available for mac o most could also spread to macintosh computer although most of these virus did not have the ability to send infected email message those virus which did take advantage of the microsoft outlook component object model com interface some old version of microsoft word allow macro to replicate themselves with additional blank line if two macro virus simultaneously infect a document the combination of the two if also selfreplicating can appear a a mating of the two and would likely be detected a a virus unique from the parentsa virus may also send a web address link a an instant message to all the contact eg friend and colleague email address stored on an infected machine if the recipient thinking the link is from a friend a trusted source follows the link to the website the virus hosted at the site may be able to infect this new computer and continue propagating virus that spread using crosssite scripting were first reported in and were academically demonstrated in there have been multiple instance of the crosssite scripting virus in the wild exploiting website such a myspace with the samy worm and yahoo countermeasure in the adapso software industry division published dealing with electronic vandalism in which they followed the risk of data loss by the added risk of losing customer confidencemany user install antivirus software that can detect and eliminate known virus when the computer attempt to download or run the executable file which may be distributed a an email attachment or on usb flash drive for example some antivirus software block known malicious website that attempt to install malware antivirus software doe not change the underlying capability of host to transmit virus user must update their software regularly to patch security vulnerability hole antivirus software also need to be regularly updated to recognize the latest threat this is because malicious hacker and other individual are always creating new virus the german avtest institute publishes evaluation of antivirus software for window and androidexamples of microsoft window anti virus and antimalware software include the optional microsoft security essential for window xp vista and window for realtime protection the window malicious software removal tool now included with window security update on patch tuesday the second tuesday of each month and window defender an optional download in the case of window xp additionally several capable antivirus software program are available for free download from the internet usually restricted to noncommercial use some such free program are almost a good a commercial competitor common security vulnerability are assigned cve id and listed in the u national vulnerability database secunia psi is an example of software free for personal use that will check a pc for vulnerable outofdate software and attempt to update it ransomware and phishing scam alert appear a press release on the internet crime complaint center noticeboard ransomware is a virus that post a message on the user screen saying that the screen or system will remain locked or unusable until a ransom payment is made phishing is a deception in which the malicious individual pretend to be a friend computer security expert or other benevolent individual with the goal of convincing the targeted individual to reveal password or other personal information other commonly used preventive measure include timely operating system update software update careful internet browsing avoiding shady website and installation of only trusted software certain browser flag site that have been reported to google and that have been confirmed a hosting malware by googlethere are two common method that an antivirus software application us to detect virus a described in the antivirus software article the first and by far the most common method of virus detection is using a list of virus signature definition this work by examining the content of the computer memory it random access memory ram and boot sector and the file stored on fixed or removable drive hard drive floppy drive or usb flash drive and comparing those file against a database of known virus signature virus signature are just string of code that are used to identify individual virus for each virus the antivirus designer try to choose a unique signature string that will not be found in a legitimate program different antivirus program use different signature to identify virus the disadvantage of this detection method is that user are only protected from virus that are detected by signature in their most recent virus definition update and not protected from new virus see zeroday attacka second method to find virus is to use a heuristic algorithm based on common virus behavior this method can detect new virus for which antivirus security firm have yet to define a signature but it also give rise to more false positive than using signature false positive can be disruptive especially in a commercial environment because it may lead to a company instructing staff not to use the company computer system until it service have checked the system for virus this can slow down productivity for regular worker recovery strategy and method one may reduce the damage done by virus by making regular backup of data and the operating system on different medium that are either kept unconnected to the system most of the time a in a hard drive readonly or not accessible for other reason such a using different file system this way if data is lost through a virus one can start again using the backup which will hopefully be recent if a backup session on optical medium like cd and dvd is closed it becomes readonly and can no longer be affected by a virus so long a a virus or infected file wa not copied onto the cddvd likewise an operating system on a bootable cd can be used to start the computer if the installed operating system become unusable backup on removable medium must be carefully inspected before restoration the gammima virus for example propagates via removable flash drivesmany website run by antivirus software company provide free online virus scanning with limited cleaning facility after all the purpose of the website is to sell antivirus product and service some websiteslike google subsidiary virustotalcomallow user to upload one or more suspicious file to be scanned and checked by one or more antivirus program in one operation additionally several capable antivirus software program are available for free download from the internet usually restricted to noncommercial use microsoft offer an optional free antivirus utility called microsoft security essential a window malicious software removal tool that is updated a part of the regular window update regime and an older optional antimalware malware removal tool window defender that ha been upgraded to an antivirus product in window some virus disable system restore and other important window tool such a task manager and cmd an example of a virus that doe this is ciadoor many such virus can be removed by rebooting the computer entering window safe mode with networking and then using system tool or microsoft safety scanner system restore on window me window xp window vista and window can restore the registry and critical system file to a previous checkpoint often a virus will cause a system to hang or freeze and a subsequent hard reboot will render a system restore point from the same day corrupted restore point from previous day should work provided the virus is not designed to corrupt the restore file and doe not exist in previous restore pointsmicrosofts system file checker improved in window and later can be used to check for and repair corrupted system file restoring an earlier clean virusfree copy of the entire partition from a cloned disk a disk image or a backup copy is one solutionrestoring an earlier backup disk image is relatively simple to do usually remove any malware and may be faster than disinfecting the computeror reinstalling and reconfiguring the operating system and program from scratch a described below then restoring user preference reinstalling the operating system is another approach to virus removal it may be possible to recover copy of essential user data by booting from a live cd or connecting the hard drive to another computer and booting from the second computer operating system taking great care not to infect that computer by executing any infected program on the original drive the original hard drive can then be reformatted and the o and all program installed from original medium once the system ha been restored precaution must be taken to avoid reinfection from any restored executable file popular culture the first known description of a selfreproducing program in fiction is in the short story the scarred man by gregory benford which describes a computer program called virus which when installed on a computer with telephone modem dialing capability randomly dial phone number until it hit a modem that is answered by another computer and then attempt to program the answering computer with it own program so that the second computer will also begin dialing random number in search of yet another computer to program the program rapidly spread exponentially through susceptible computer and can only be countered by a second program called vaccine his story wa based on an actual computer virus written in fortran that benford had created and run on the lab computer in the a a proofofconcept and which he told john brunner about in idea wa explored further in two novel when harlie wa one by david gerrold and the terminal man by michael crichton and became a major theme of the novel the shockwave rider by john brunnerthe michael crichton scifi film westworld made an early mention of the concept of a computer virus being a central plot theme that cause android to run amok alan oppenheimer character summarizes the problem by stating that there a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy to an infectious disease process spreading from onearea to the next to which the reply are stated perhaps there are superficial similarity to disease and i must confess i find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery other malware the term virus is also misused by extension to refer to other type of malware malware encompasses computer virus along with many other form of malicious software such a computer worm ransomware spyware adware trojan horse keyloggers rootkits bootkits malicious browser helper object bhos and other malicious software the majority of active malware threat are trojan horse program or computer worm rather than computer virus the term computer virus coined by fred cohen in is a misnomer virus often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computer such a acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit cpu time accessing and stealing private information eg credit card number debit card number phone number name email address password bank information house address etc corrupting data displaying political humorous or threatening message on the user screen spamming their email contact logging their keystroke or even rendering the computer useless however not all virus carry a destructive payload and attempt to hide themselvesthe defining characteristic of virus is that they are selfreplicating computer program that modify other software without user consent by injecting themselves into the said program similar to a biological virus which replicates within living cell see also note reference further reading external link virus at curlie dmoz microsoft security portal u govt cert computer emergency readiness

matteringpressorg isbn archiv from the origin pdf on,in cryptography encryption is the process of encoding information this process convert the original representation of the information known a plaintext into an alternative form known a ciphertext ideally only authorized party can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information encryption doe not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a wouldbe interceptor for technical reason an encryption scheme usually us a pseudorandom encryption key generated by an algorithm it is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but for a welldesigned encryption scheme considerable computational resource and skill are required an authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipient but not to unauthorized user historically various form of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography early encryption technique were often used in military messaging since then new technique have emerged and become commonplace in all area of modern computing modern encryption scheme use the concept of publickey and symmetrickey modern encryption technique ensure security because modern computer are inefficient at cracking the encryption history ancient one of the earliest form of encryption is symbol replacement which wa first found in the tomb of khnumhotep ii who lived in bc egypt symbol replacement encryption is nonstandard which mean that the symbol require a cipher or key to understand this type of early encryption wa used throughout ancient greece and rome for military purpose one of the most famous military encryption development wa the caesar cipher which wa a system in which a letter in normal text is shifted down a fixed number of position down the alphabet to get the encoded letter a message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the caesar cipher around ad arab mathematician alkindi developed the technique of frequency analysis which wa an attempt to systematically crack caesar cipher this technique looked at the frequency of letter in the encrypted message to determine the appropriate shift this technique wa rendered ineffective after the creation of the polyalphabetic cipher by leon battista alberti in which incorporated different set of language in order for frequency analysis to be useful the person trying to decrypt the message would need to know which language the sender chose century around thomas jefferson theorized a cipher to encode and decode message in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence the cipher known today a the wheel cipher or the jefferson disk although never actually built wa theorized a a spool that could jumble an english message up to character the message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher a similar device to the jefferson disk the wa developed in independently by u army major joseph mauborne this device wa used in u military communication until world war ii the axis power used a more advanced version of the called the enigma machine the enigma machine wa more complex because unlike the jefferson wheel and the each day the jumble of letter switched to a completely new combination each day combination wa only known by the axis so many thought the only way to break the code would be to try over combination within hour the ally used computing power to severely limit the number of reasonable combination they needed to check every day leading to the breaking of the enigma machine modern today encryption is used in the transfer of communication over the internet for security and commerce a computing power continues to increase computer encryption is constantly evolving to prevent eavesdropping attack with one of the first modern cipher suite de utilizing a key with possibility being able to be cracked in hour and minute by effs de cracker in which used a bruteforce method of cracking modern encryption standard often use stronger key size often like mode twofish serpentconfigurable up to cipher suite utilizing a or higher key like aes will not be able to be bruteforced due to the total amount of key of possibility the most likely option for cracking cipher with high key size is to find vulnerability in the cipher itself like inherent bias and backdoor for example a stream cipher wa cracked due to inherent bias and vulnerability in the cipher encryption in cryptography in the context of cryptography encryption serf a a mechanism to ensure confidentiality since data may be visible on the internet sensitive information such a password and personal communication may be exposed to potential interceptor the process of encrypting and decrypting message involves key the two main type of key in cryptographic system are symmetrickey and publickey also known a asymmetrickeymany complex cryptographic algorithm often use simple modular arithmetic in their implementation type in symmetrickey scheme the encryption and decryption key are the same communicating party must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication the german enigma machine utilized a new symmetrickey each day for encoding and decoding message in publickey encryption scheme the encryption key is published for anyone to use and encrypt message however only the receiving party ha access to the decryption key that enables message to be read publickey encryption wa first described in a secret document in beforehand all encryption scheme were symmetrickey also called privatekey although published subsequently the work of diffie and hellman wa published in a journal with a large readership and the value of the methodology wa explicitly described the method became known a the diffiehellman key exchange rsa rivestshamiradleman is another notable publickey cryptosystem created in it is still used today for application involving digital signature using number theory the rsa algorithm selects two prime number which help generate both the encryption and decryption keysa publicly available publickey encryption application called pretty good privacy pgp wa written in by phil zimmermann and distributed free of charge with source code pgp wa purchased by symantec in and is regularly updated us encryption ha long been used by military and government to facilitate secret communication it is now commonly used in protecting information within many kind of civilian system for example the computer security institute reported that in of company surveyed utilized encryption for some of their data in transit and utilized encryption for some of their data in storage encryption can be used to protect data at rest such a information stored on computer and storage device eg usb flash drive in recent year there have been numerous report of confidential data such a customer personal record being exposed through loss or theft of laptop or backup drive encrypting such file at rest help protect them if physical security measure fail digital right management system which prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted material and protect software against reverse engineering see also copy protection is another somewhat different example of using encryption on data at restencryption is also used to protect data in transit for example data being transferred via network eg the internet ecommerce mobile telephone wireless microphone wireless intercom system bluetooth device and bank automatic teller machine there have been numerous report of data in transit being intercepted in recent year data should also be encrypted when transmitted across network in order to protect against eavesdropping of network traffic by unauthorized user data erasure conventional method for permanently deleting data from a storage device involve overwriting the device whole content with zero one or other pattern a process which can take a significant amount of time depending on the capacity and the type of storage medium cryptography offer a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous this method is called cryptoshredding an example implementation of this method can be found on io device where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated effaceable storage because the key is stored on the same device this setup on it own doe not offer full privacy or security protection if an unauthorized person gain physical access to the device limitation encryption is used in the century to protect digital data and information system a computing power increased over the year encryption technology ha only become more advanced and secure however this advancement in technology ha also exposed a potential limitation of today encryption method the length of the encryption key is an indicator of the strength of the encryption method for example the original encryption key de data encryption standard wa bit meaning it had combination possibility with today computing power a key is no longer secure being vulnerable to brute force attacksquantum computing utilizes property of quantum mechanic in order to process large amount of data simultaneously quantum computing ha been found to achieve computing speed thousand of time faster than today supercomputer this computing power present a challenge to today encryption technology for example rsa encryption utilizes the multiplication of very large prime number to create a semiprime number for it public key decoding this key without it private key requires this semiprime number to be factored which can take a very long time to do with modern computer it would take a supercomputer anywhere between week to month to factor in this key however quantum computing can use quantum algorithm to factor this semiprime number in the same amount of time it take for normal computer to generate it this would make all data protected by current publickey encryption vulnerable to quantum computing attack other encryption technique like elliptic curve cryptography and symmetric key encryption are also vulnerable to quantum computingwhile quantum computing could be a threat to encryption security in the future quantum computing a it currently stand is still very limited quantum computing currently is not commercially available can not handle large amount of code and only exists a computational device not computer furthermore quantum computing advancement will be able to be utilized in favor of encryption a well the national security agency nsa is currently preparing postquantum encryption standard for the future quantum encryption promise a level of security that will be able to counter the threat of quantum computing attack and countermeasure encryption is an important tool but is not sufficient alone to ensure the security or privacy of sensitive information throughout it lifetime most application of encryption protect information only at rest or in transit leaving sensitive data in clear text and potentially vulnerable to improper disclosure during processing such a by a cloud service for example homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation are emerging technique to compute on encrypted data these technique are general and turing complete but incur high computational andor communication cost in response to encryption of data at rest cyberadversaries have developed new type of attack these more recent threat to encryption of data at rest include cryptographic attack stolen ciphertext attack attack on encryption key insider attack data corruption or integrity attack data destruction attack and ransomware attack data fragmentation and active defense data protection technology attempt to counter some of these attack by distributing moving or mutating ciphertext so it is more difficult to identify steal corrupt or destroy the debate around encryption the question of balancing the need for national security with the right to privacy ha been debated for year since encryption ha become critical in today digital society the modern encryption debate started around the when u government tried to ban cryptography because according to them it would threaten national security the debate is polarized around two opposing view those who see strong encryption a a problem making it easier for criminal to hide their illegal act online and others who argue that encryption keep digital communication safe the debate heated up in when big tech like apple and google set encryption by default in their device this wa the start of a series of controversy that put government company and internet user at stake integrity protection of ciphertexts encryption by itself can protect the confidentiality of message but other technique are still needed to protect the integrity and authenticity of a message for example verification of a message authentication code mac or a digital signature usually done by a hashing algorithm or a pgp signature authenticated encryption algorithm are designed to provide both encryption and integrity protection together standard for cryptographic software and hardware to perform encryption are widely available but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem a single error in system design or execution can allow successful attack sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption see for example traffic analysis tempest or trojan horseintegrity protection mechanism such a mac and digital signature must be applied to the ciphertext when it is first created typically on the same device used to compose the message to protect a message endtoend along it full transmission path otherwise any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself ha correct key and ha not been tampered with if an endpoint device ha been configured to trust a root certificate that an attacker control for example then the attacker can both inspect and tamper with encrypted data by performing a maninthemiddle attack anywhere along the message path the common practice of tl interception by network operator represents a controlled and institutionally sanctioned form of such an attack but country have also attempted to employ such attack a a form of control and censorship ciphertext length and padding even when encryption correctly hide a message content and it can not be tampered with at rest or in transit a message length is a form of metadata that can still leak sensitive information about the message for example the wellknown crime and breach attack against http were sidechannel attack that relied on information leakage via the length of encrypted content traffic analysis is a broad class of technique that often employ message length to infer sensitive implementation about traffic flow by aggregating information about a large number of message padding a message payload before encrypting it can help obscure the cleartexts true length at the cost of increasing the ciphertexts size and introducing or increasing bandwidth overhead message may be padded randomly or deterministically with each approach having different tradeoff encrypting and padding message to form padded uniform random blob or purbs is a practice guaranteeing that the cipher text

hardware software or data a well a from the disruption or misdirection of the service they providethe field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer system the internet and wireless network standard such a bluetooth and wifi also due to the growth of smart device including smartphones television and the various device that constitute the internet of thing iot cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenge of the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information system and the society they support security is of especially high importance for system that govern largescale system with farreaching physical effect such a power distribution election and finance vulnerability and attack a vulnerability is a weakness in design implementation operation or internal control of a computer or system most of the vulnerability that have been discovered are documented in the common vulnerability and exposure cve database an exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists vulnerability can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tool or customized scriptsvarious people or party are vulnerable to cyber attack however different group are likely to experience different type of attack more than othersin april the united kingdom department for science innovation technology realised a report on cyber attack over the last month they surveyed uk business uk registered charity and education institution the research found that of business and of charity overall recall any breach or attack from the last month this figure were much higher for medium business large business and highincome charity with or more in annual income yet although medium or large business are more often the victim since larger company have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize business smbs have also become increasing vulnerable a they often do not have advanced tool to defend the business smbs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attack and denialof service do attacksnormal people working for a business or simply using the internet are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyber attack these are where attacker indiscriminately target a many device service or user a possible they do this using technique that take advantage of the openness of the internet these strategy mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanningto secure a computer system it is important to understand the attack that can be made against it and these threat can typically be classified into one of the following category backdoor a backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security control these weakness may exist for many reason including original design or poor configuration due to the nature of backdoor they are of greater concern to company and database a opposed to individual backdoor may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reason however criminal often use malware to install backdoor giving them remote administrative access to a system once they have access cybercriminals can modify file steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computerbackdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who ha access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer denialofservice attack denial of service attack do are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to it intended user attacker can deny service to individual victim such a by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive time to cause the victim account to be locked or they may overload the capability of a machine or network and block all user at once while a network attack from a single ip address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many form of distributed denial of service ddos attack are possible where the attack come from a large number of point and defending is much more difficult such attack can originate from the zombie computer of a botnet or from a range of other possible technique including distributed reflective denial of service drdos where innocent system are fooled into sending traffic to the victim with such attack the amplification factor make the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves to understand why attacker may carry out these attack see the attacker motivation section directaccess attack a directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gain physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or to steal information attacker may also compromise security by making operating system modification installing software worm keyloggers covert listening device or using wireless microphone even when the system is protected by standard security measure these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a cdrom or other bootable medium disk encryption and trusted platform module are designed to prevent these attack direct service attacker are related in concept to direct memory attack that allows an attacker to gain direct access to a computer memory the attack take advantage of a feature of modern computer that allow certain device such a external hard drive graphic card or network card to access the computer memory directlyto help prevent these attack computer user must ensure that they have a strong password that their computer is locked at all time when they are not using it and that they keep their computer with them at all time when traveling eavesdropping eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between host on a network it typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various method unlike malware directaccess attack or other form of cyber attack eavesdropping attack are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of network or device making them difficult to notice in fact the attacker doe not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all he or she can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined timeusing a virtual private network vpn which encrypts data between two point is one of the most common form of protection against eavesdropping using the best form of encryption possible for wireless network is best practice a well a using http instead of unencrypted httpprograms such a carnivore and narusinsight have been used by the federal bureau of investigation fbi and nsa to eavesdrop on the system of internet service provider even machine that operate a a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmission generated by the hardware tempest is a specification by the nsa referring to these attack malware malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or it user once present on a computer it can leak sensitive detail such a personal information business information and password can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victim machine encrypts their file and then turn around and demand a ransom usually in bitcoin to return that data to the usertypes of malware include some of the following virus are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijack software with the intension to do damage and spread copy of itself copy are made with the aim to spread to other program on a computer worm are similar to virus however virus can only function when a user run open a comprised program worm therefore are selfreplicating malware that spread between program apps and device without the need for human interaction trojan horse are program that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick user into installing them once installed a rat remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device spyware is a type of malware that secretly gather information on an infected computer and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker one of the most common form of spyware are known a keyloggers which is a kind of malware which recorder all of a user keyboard inputskeystrokes used to allow hacker to harvest usernames password bank account and credit card number scareware a the name suggests is a form of malware which us social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate user into buying or installing unwanted software these attack often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device ha a virus multivector polymorphic attack surfacing in a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threat combined several type of attack and changed form to avoid cybersecurity control a they spread multivector polymorphic attack a the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic firstly they are a singular offensive that involves multiple method of attack in this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple mean of propagation such a via the web email and application however they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate network and move laterally inside the network the attack can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such a virus worm or trojan constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defence phishing phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such a usernames password and credit card detail directly from user by deceiving the user phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call and it often directs user to enter detail at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one the fake website often asks for personal information such a login detail and password this information can then be used to gain access to the individual real account on the real website preying on a victim trust phishing can be classified a a form of social engineering attacker are using creative way to gain access to real account a common scam is for attacker to send fake electronic invoice to individual showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchase were not authorized a more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverage personal or organizationspecific detail to make the attacker appear like a trusted source spearphishing attack target specific individual rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempt privilege escalation privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privilege or access level for example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system the severity of attack can range from attack simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amount of data privilege escalation usually start with social engineering technique often phishingprivilege escalation can be separated into to strategy horizontal and vertical privilege escalation horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gain access to a normal user account that ha relatively lowlevel privilege this may be through stealing the user username and password once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of user at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege vertical escalation however target people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such a an employee in it with a higher privilege using this privileged account will then enable to attacker to invade other account sidechannel attack any computational system affect it environment in some form this effect it ha on it environment includes a wide range of criterion which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on ram cell which a a consequence make a cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation fault that allow for access and or guessing of other value that normally should be inaccessible in sidechannel attack scenario the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess it internal state and a a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure social engineering social engineering in the context of computer security aim to convince a user to disclose secret such a password card number etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer this generally involves exploiting people trust and relying on their cognitive bias a common scam involves email sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their ceo and urgently requesting some action one of the main technique of social engineering are phishing attack in early the fbi reported that such business email compromise bec scam had cost u business more than billion in about two yearsin may the milwaukee buck nba team wa the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team president peter feigin resulting in the handover of all the team employee tax form spoofing spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such a an ip address or username in order to gain access to information or resource that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain spoofing is closely related to phishing there are several type of spoofing including email spoofing is where an attacker forge the sending from or source address of an email ip address spoofing where an attacker alters the source ip address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system mac spoofing where an attacker modifies the medium access control mac address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose a another biometric spoofing where an attacker produce a fake biometric sample to pose a another user address resolution protocol arp spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their medium access control address with a different host ip address this cause data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended hostin the cybersecurity firm trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry tampering tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data an intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system component of system it intended behavior or data socalled evil maid attack and security service planting of surveillance capability into router are example html smuggling html smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular html or web page html file can carry payload concealed a benign inert data in order to defeat content filter these payload can be reconstructed on the other side of the filterwhen a target user open the html the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the target device information security culture employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organization cultural concept can help different segment of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization information security culture is the totality of pattern of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kindsandersson and reimers found that employee often do not see themselves a part of their organization information security effort and often take action that impede organizational change indeed the verizon data breach investigation report which examined security breach discovered of cybersecurity incident involved internal actor within a company research show information security culture need to be improved continuously in information security culture from analysis to change author commented it a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance to manage the information security culture five step should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation preevaluation to identify the awareness of information security within employee and to analyze the current security policy strategic planning to come up with a better awareness program clear target need to be set assembling a team of skilled professional is helpful to achieve it operative planning a good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program implementation four stage should be used to implement the information security culture they arecommitment of the management communication with organizational member course for all organizational member commitment of the employeespostevaluation to ass the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved area of concern computer protection countermeasure in computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be takensome common countermeasure are listed in the following section security by design security by design or alternately secure by design mean that the software ha been designed from the ground up to be secure in this case security is considered a main feature the uk government national cyber security centre separate secure cyber design principle into five section before a secure system is created or updated company should ensure they understand the fundamental and the context around the system they are trying to create and to identify any apart weakness in a system company should design and centre their security around technique and defence which make attacking their data or system inherently more challenging for attacker company should ensure that their core service that rely on technology are protected so that the technology is always available although system can be created which are safe against a multitude of attack that doe not mean that attack will not be attempted despite one security all company system should aim to be able to detect and spot attack a soon a they occur to ensure the most effective response to them company should create secure system designed so that any attack that is successful ha a loss severitythese design principle of security by design can include some of the following technique the principle of least privilege where each part of the system ha only the privilege that are needed for it function that way even if an attacker gain access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystem code review and unit testing approach to make module more secure where formal correctness proof are not possible defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem need to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it hold default secure setting and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authority in order to make it insecure audit trail track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined storing audit trail remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruder from covering their track full disclosure of all vulnerability to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept a short a possible when bug are discovered security architecture security architecture can be defined a the practice of designing computer system to achieve security goal these goal have overlap with the principle of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise in practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new change are safe and meet the security requirement of the organisationsimilarly techopedia defines security architecture a a unified security design that address the necessity and potential risk involved in a certain scenario or environment it also specifies when and where to apply security control the design process is generally reproducible the key attribute of security architecture are the relationship of different component and how they depend on each other determination of control based on risk assessment good practice finance and legal matter the standardization of controlspracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business it and security concern in an organization security measure a state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of the three process threat prevention detection and response these process are based on various policy and system component which include the following limiting the access of individual using user account access control and using cryptography can protect system file and data respectively firewall are by far the most common prevention system from a network security perspective a they can if properly configured shield access to internal network service and block certain kind of attack through packet filtering firewall can be both hardware and softwarebased firewall monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network intrusion detection system id product are designed to detect network attack inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trail and log serve a similar function for individual system response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirement of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protection to notification of legal authority counterattack and the like in some special case the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored a it may happen that not all the compromised resource are detected cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threat and attack forward web proxy solution can prevent the client to visit malicious web page and inspect the content before downloading to the client machinestoday computer security consists mainly of preventive measure like firewall or an exit procedure a firewall can be defined a a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such a the internet they can be implemented a software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most unixbased operating system such a linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic firewall are common amongst machine that are permanently connected to the internet some organization are turning to big data platform such a apache hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threatsin order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known a the cia triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security to achieve those objective administrative physical and technical security measure should be employed the amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when it value is known vulnerability management vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerability especially in software and firmware vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security vulnerability can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerability such a open port insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware in order for these tool to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release typically these update will scan for the new vulnerability that were introduced recently beyond vulnerability scanning many organization contract outside security auditor to run regular penetration test against their system to identify vulnerability in some sector this is a contractual requirement reducing vulnerability the act of assessing and reducing vulnerability to cyber attack is commonly referred to a information technology security assessment they aim to ass system for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerability while formal verification of the correctness of computer system is possible it is not yet common operating system formally verified include and sysgos pikeos but these make up a very small percentage of the market it is possible to reduce an attacker chance by keeping system up to date with security patch and update andor hiring people with expertise in security large company with significant threat can hire security operation centre soc analyst these are specialist in cyber defence with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating report of any new issue and preparing and testing disaster recovery planswhilst no measure can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measure can help mitigate the damage of possible attack the effect of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance outside of formal assessment there are various method of reducing vulnerability two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information it requires something you know a password or pin and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware this increase security a an unauthorized person need both of these to gain access protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attack can only be occur by noncomputer mean which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving people knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing people awareness of threat however even in highly disciplined environment eg military organization social engineering attack can still be difficult to foresee and prevent inoculation derived from inoculation theory seek to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent trick or trap by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempt through exposure to similar or related attempt hardware protection mechanism hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offer an alternative to softwareonly computer security using device and method such a dongle trusted platform module intrusionaware case drive lock disabling usb port and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised each of these is covered in more detail below usb dongle are typically used in software licensing scheme to unlock software capability but they can also be seen a a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device software the dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key the principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such a advanced encryption standard aes provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it another security application for dongle is to use them for accessing webbased content such a cloud software or virtual private network vpns in addition a usb dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer trusted platform module tpms secure device by integrating cryptographic capability onto access device through the use of microprocessor or socalled computersonachip tpms used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware device preventing unauthorized network and data access computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened the firmware or bios is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time drive lock are essentially software tool to encrypt hard drive making them inaccessible to thief tool exist specifically for encrypting external drive a well disabling usb port is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer infected usb dongle connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine network world a the most common hardware threat facing computer network disconnecting or disabling peripheral device like camera gps removable storage etc that are not in use mobileenabled access device are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phone builtin capability such a bluetooth the newer bluetooth low energy le nearfield communication nfc on nonios device and biometric validation such a thumbprint reader a well a qr code reader software designed for mobile device offer new secure way for mobile phone to connect to access control system these control system provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure building iommus allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of component in mobile and desktop computer by utilizing direct memory access protection physical unclonable function pufs can be used a a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuit and hardware providing user the ability to secure the hardware supply chain going into their system secure operating system one use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating system using secure operating system is a good way of ensuring computer security these are system that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluation are common criterion cc secure coding in software engineering secure coding aim to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerability it is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure such system are secure by design beyond this formal verification aim to prove the correctness of the algorithm underlying a system important for cryptographic protocol for example capability and access control list within computer system two of the main security model capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control list acls and rolebased access control rbac an accesscontrol list acl with respect to a computer file system is a list of permission associated with an object an acl specifies which user or system process are granted access to object a well a what operation are allowed on given object rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized user used by the majority of enterprise with more than employee and can implement mandatory access control mac or discretionary access control dac a further approach capabilitybased security ha been mostly restricted to research operating system capability can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design an opensource project in the area is the e language user security training the enduser is widely recognized a the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than of security incident and breach involve some kind of human error among the most commonly recorded form of error and misjudgment are poor password management sending email containing sensitive data and attachment to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading url and to identify fake website and dangerous email attachment a common mistake that user make is saving their user idpassword in their browser to make it easier to log in to banking site this is a gift to attacker who have obtained access to a machine by some mean the risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authenticationas the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all level not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandate but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individual and company from the great majority of cyber threat the focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioner who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and move along the line suggested by major security center to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attack digital hygiene related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and a the analogy with personal hygiene show is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measure to minimize the risk from cyber threat the assumption is that good cyber hygiene practice can give networked user another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attack or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military termthe most common act of digitalcyber hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backup password and ensuring restricted admin right and network firewall a opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threat cyber hygiene mostly regard routine measure that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education it can be thought of a an abstract list of tip or measure that have been demonstrated a having a positive effect on personal andor collective digital security a such these measure can be performed by laypeople not just security expert cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene a computer virus relate to biological virus or pathogen however while the term computer virus wa coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer virus the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps a late a by internet pioneer vint cerf it ha since been adopted by the congress and senate of the united state the fbi eu institution and head of state difficulty of responding to breach responding to attempted security breach is often very difficult for a variety of reason including identifying attacker is difficult a they may operate through proxy temporary anonymous dialup account wireless connection and other anonymizing procedure which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction if they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete log to cover their track the sheer number of attempted attack often by automated vulnerability scanner and computer worm is so large that organization can not spend time pursuing each law enforcement officer often lack the skill interest or budget to pursue attacker in addition the identification of attacker across a network may require log from various point in the network and in many country which may be difficult or timeconsuming to obtainwhere an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdiction now have in place mandatory security breach notification law type of security and privacy system at risk the growth in the number of computer system and the increasing reliance upon them by individual business industry and government mean that there are an increasing number of system at risk financial system the computer system of financial regulator and financial institution like the u security and exchange commission swift investment bank and commercial bank are prominent hacking target for cybercriminals interested in manipulating market and making illicit gain website and apps that accept or store credit card number brokerage account and bank account information are also prominent hacking target because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchase or selling the information on the black market instore payment system and atm have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and pin the ucla internet report surveying the digital future found that the privacy of personal data created barrier to online sale and that more than nine out of internet user were somewhat or very concerned about credit card securitythe most common web technology for improving security between browser and website are named ssl secure socket layer and it successor tl transport layer security identity management and authentication service and domain name service allow company and consumer to engage in secure communication and commerce several version of ssl and tl are commonly used today in application such a web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and voip voiceoverip there are various interoperable implementation of these technology including at least one implementation that is open source open source allows anyone to view the application source code and look for and report vulnerability the credit card company visa and mastercard cooperated to develop the secure emv chip which is embedded in credit card further development include the chip authentication program where bank give customer handheld card reader to perform online secure transaction other development in this arena include the development of technology such a instant issuance which ha enabled shopping mall kiosk acting on behalf of bank to issue onthespot credit card to interested customer utility and industrial equipment computer control function at many utility including coordination of telecommunication the power grid nuclear power plant and valve opening and closing in water and gas network the internet is a potential attack vector for such machine if connected but the stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computer not connected to the internet can be vulnerable in the computer emergency readiness team a division of the department of homeland security investigated hacking incident at energy company aviation the aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex system which could be attacked a simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussion worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmission which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over ocean is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends to mile offshore there is also potential for attack from within an aircraftin europe with the paneuropean network service and newpens and in the u with the nextgen program air navigation service provider are moving to create their own dedicated network many modern passport are now biometric passport containing an embedded microchip that store a digitized photograph and personal information such a name gender and date of birth in addition more country are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud the introduction of the epassport ha assisted border official in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing plan are under way in the u the uk and australia to introduce smartgate kiosk with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology the airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper ticket towards the use of electronic ticket etickets these have been made possible by advance in online credit card transaction in partnership with the airline longdistance bus company are also switching over to eticketing transaction today the consequence of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outage loss of aircraft and even loss of life consumer device desktop computer and laptop are commonly targeted to gather password or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target smartphones tablet computer smart watch and other mobile device such a quantified self device like activity tracker have sensor such a camera microphone gps receiver compass and accelerometer which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information wifi bluetooth and cell phone network on any of these device could be used a attack vector and sensor might be remotely activated after a successful breachthe increasing number of home automation device such a the nest thermostat are also potential target healthcare today many healthcare provider and health insurance company use the internet to provide enhanced product and service for example through use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness tracker to lower insurance premium the health care company humana partner with webmd oracle corporation ed and microsoft to enable it member to access their health care record a well a to provide an overview of health care plan patient record are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse network alleviating the need for extra storage space large corporation large corporation are common target in many case attack are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breach example include the loss of million of client credit card and financial detail by home depot staple target corporation and equifaxmedical record have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patient to obtain prescription drug for recreational purpose or resale although cyber threat continue to increase of all organization did not increase security training for their business in all attack are financially motivated however security firm hbgary federal had a serious series of attack in from hacktivist group anonymous in retaliation for the firm ceo claiming to have infiltrated their group and sony picture wa hacked in with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leak and crippling the company by wiping workstation and server automobile vehicle are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brake seat belt tensioners door lock airbags and advanced driverassistance system on many model additionally connected car may use wifi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer device and the cell phone network selfdriving car are expected to be even more complex all of these system carry some security risk and such issue have gained wide attentionsimple example of risk include a malicious compact disc being used a an attack vector and the car onboard microphone being used for eavesdropping however if access is gained to a car internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized test hacker remotely carjacked a vehicle from mile away and drove it into a ditchmanufacturers are reacting in numerous way with tesla in pushing out some security fix over the air into it car computer system in the area of autonomous vehicle in september the united state department of transportation announced some initial safety standard and called for state to come up with uniform policiesadditionally edrivers license are being developed using the same technology for example mexico licensing authority icv ha used a smart card platform to issue the first edrivers license to the city of monterrey in the state of nuevo len shipping shipping company have adopted rfid radio frequency identification technology a an efficient digitally secure tracking device unlike a barcode rfid can be read up to foot away rfid is used by fedex and ups government government and military computer system are commonly attacked by activist and foreign power local and regional government infrastructure such a traffic light control police and intelligence agency communication personnel record a well a student recordsthe fbi cia and pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their building however the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world more and more company are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology ge acuvision for example offer a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording internet of thing and physical vulnerability the internet of thing iot is the network of physical object such a device vehicle and building that are embedded with electronics software sensor and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data concern have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenge involvedwhile the iot creates opportunity for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased system it also provides opportunity for misuse in particular a the internet of thing spread widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat if a front door lock is connected to the internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone people could stand to lose much more than their credit card number in a world controlled by iotenabled device thief have also used electronic mean to circumvent noninternetconnected hotel door locksan attack that target physical infrastructure andor human life is sometimes referred to a a cyberkinetic attack a iot device and appliance gain currency cyberkinetic attack can become pervasive and significantly damaging medical system medical device have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerability demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted device including pacemaker and insulin pump there are many report of hospital and hospital organization getting hacked including ransomware attack window xp exploit virus and data breach of sensitive data stored on hospital server on december the u food and drug administration released it recommendation for how medical device manufacturer should maintain the security of internetconnected device but no structure for enforcement energy sector in distributed generation system the risk of a cyber attack is real according to daily energy insider an attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just a severe consequence a a natural disaster the district of columbia is considering creating a distributed energy resource der authority within the city with the goal being for customer to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand the dc proposal however would allow thirdparty vendor to create numerous point of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunity for cyber attacker to threaten the electric grid telecommunication perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the sim subscriber identity module card a device that is embedded in most of the world cellular device before any service can be obtained the sim card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment the smart card web server draft standard scws defines the interface to an http server in a smart card test are being conducted to secure ota overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone combination simdvd device are being developed through smart video card technology which embeds a dvdcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular sim card other telecommunication development involving digital security include mobile signature which use the embedded sim card to generate a legally binding electronic signature cost and impact of security breach serious financial damage ha been caused by security breach but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organization involved several computer security consulting firm produce estimate of total worldwide loss attributable to virus and worm attack and to hostile digital act in general the loss estimate by these firm range from billion worm and virus only to billion for all form of covert attack the reliability of these estimate is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotalhowever reasonable estimate of the financial cost of security breach can actually help organization make rational investment decision according to the classic gordonloeb model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach attacker motivation a with physical security the motivation for breach of computer security vary between attacker some are thrillseekers or vandal some are activist others are criminal looking for financial gain statesponsored attacker are now common and well resourced but started with amateur such a markus hess who hacked for the kgb a recounted by clifford stoll in the cuckoo egg attacker motivation can vary for all type of attack from pleasure to for political goal for example hacktivists may target a company a company or organisation that carry out activity they do not agree with this would be to create bad publicity for the company by having it website crash high capability hacker often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demand of their financial backer these attack are more likely to attempt more serious attack an example of a more serious attack wa the ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of file and denialofservice attack to carry out the full attackadditionally recent attacker motivation can be traced back to extremist organization seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agenda the growth of the internet mobile technology and inexpensive computing device have led to a rise in capability but also to the risk to environment that are deemed a vital to operation all critical targeted environment are susceptible to compromise and this ha led to a series of proactive study on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivation by these type of actor several stark difference exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actor seeking to attack based on an ideological preferencea standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system and who might be motivated to breach it the level and detail of precaution will vary depending on the system to be secured a home personal computer bank and classified military network face very different threat even when the underlying technology in use are similar computer security incident management computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack an incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such a a data breach or system failure the intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business a usual responding to compromise quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerability restore service and process and minimize loss incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practice to stop an intrusion before it cause damage typical incident response plan contain a set of written instruction that outline the organization response to a cyberattack without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholder may not understand their role process and procedure during an escalation slowing the organization response and resolution there are four key component of a computer security incident response plan preparation preparing stakeholder on the procedure for handling computer security incident or compromise detection and analysis identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident containment eradication and recovery isolating affected system to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected system and bad actor from the environment and restoring system and data when a threat no longer remains post incident activity post mortem analysis of the incident it root cause and the organization response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response effort notable attack and breach some illustrative example of different type of computer security breach are given below robert morris and the first computer worm in computer were connected to the internet and most were mainframe minicomputer and professional workstation on november many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computer the first internet computer worm the software wa traced back to cornell university graduate student robert tappan morris who said he wanted to count how many machine were connected to the internet rome laboratory in over a hundred intrusion were made by unidentified cracker into the rome laboratory the u air force main command and research facility using trojan horse hacker were able to obtain unrestricted access to rome networking system and remove trace of their activity the intruder were able to obtain classified file such a air tasking order system data and furthermore able to penetrate connected network of national aeronautics and space administration goddard space flight center wrightpatterson air force base some defense contractor and other private sector organization by posing a a trusted rome center user tjx customer credit card detail in early american apparel and home good company tjx announced that it wa the victim of an unauthorized computer system intrusion and that the hacker had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transaction stuxnet attack in the computer worm known a stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of iran nuclear centrifuge it did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controller plcs in a targeted attack this is generally believed to have been launched by israel and the united state to disrupt iran nuclear program although neither ha publicly admitted this global surveillance disclosure in early document provided by edward snowden were published by the washington post and the guardian exposing the massive scale of nsa global surveillance there were also indication that the nsa may have inserted a backdoor in a nist standard for encryption this standard wa later withdrawn due to widespread criticism the nsa additionally were revealed to have tapped the link between google data center target and home depot breach a ukrainian hacker known a rescator broke into target corporation computer in stealing roughly million credit card and then home depot computer in stealing between and million credit card number warning were delivered at both corporation but ignored physical security breach using self checkout machine are believed to have played a large role the malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting say jim walter director of threat intelligence operation at security technology company mcafee meaning that the heist could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrator responded to the warning the size of the theft ha resulted in major attention from state and federal united state authority and the investigation is ongoing office of personnel management data breach in april the office of personnel management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately million personnel record handled by the office the office of personnel management hack ha been described by federal official a among the largest breach of government data in the history of the united state data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such a social security number name date and place of birth address and fingerprint of current and former government employee a well a anyone who had undergone a government background check it is believed the hack wa perpetrated by chinese hacker ashley madison breach in july a hacker group is known a the impact team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website ashley madison created by avid life medium the group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data a well after the breach the impact team dumped email from the company ceo to prove their point and threatened to dump customer data unless the website wa taken down permanently when avid life medium did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed file one and the second after the second data dump avid life medium ceo noel biderman resigned but the website remained to function colonial pipeline ransomware attack in june the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the u and led to shortage across the east coast legal issue and global regulation international legal issue of cyber attack are complicated in nature there is no global base of common rule to judge and eventually punish cybercrime and cybercriminals and where security firm or agency do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authority can not take action due to lack of law under which to prosecute proving attribution for cybercrime and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agency computer virus switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operation like this so the internet is a if someone had given free plane ticket to all the online criminal of the world the use of technique such a dynamic dns fast flux and bullet proof server add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement role of government the role of the government is to make regulation to force company and organization to protect their system infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect it own national infrastructure such a the national powergridthe government regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated for some cyberspace wa seen a a virtual space that wa to remain free of government intervention a can be seen in many of today libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussionsmany government official and expert think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem r clarke said during a panel discussion at the rsa security conference in san francisco he belief that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation if the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through on the other hand executive from the private sector agree that improvement are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently daniel r mccarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political orderon may the un security council held it second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenge to international peace according to un secretarygeneral

the acquisition of skill necessary for an elevated cybersecurity posture this groundbreaking initiative wa jointly disclosed by minister for cyber security clare oneil and minister for small business julie collins america the united state ha it first fully formed cyber plan in year a a result of the release of this national cyber plan in this policy the u say it will protect the country by keeping network system function and data safe promote american wealth by building a strong digital economy and encouraging strong domestic innovation peace and safety should be kept by making it easier for the u to stop people from using computer tool for bad thing working with friend and partner to do this and increase the united state impact around the world to support the main idea behind an open safe reliable and compatible internet the new u cyber strategy seek to allay some of those concern by promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace urging nation to adhere to a set of norm both through international law and voluntary standard it also call for specific measure to harden u government network from attack like the june intrusion into the u office of personnel management opm which compromised the record of about million current and former government employee and the strategy call for the u to continue to name and shame bad cyber actor calling them out publicly for attack when possible along with the use of economic sanction and diplomatic pressure india some provision for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rule framed under the information technology act national

christian science monitor wrote in a article titled the new cyber arm race in the future war will not just be fought by soldier with gun or with plane that drop bomb they will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer program that disrupt or destroy critical industry like utility transportation communication and energy such attack could also disable military network that control the movement of troop the path of jet fighter the command and control of warship this ha led to new term such a cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism the united state cyber command wa created in and many other country have similar force there are a few critical voice that question whether cybersecurity is a significant a threat a it is made out to be career cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of it concerned with reducing organization risk of hack or data breach according to research from the enterprise strategy group of organization say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skill in up from in commercial government and nongovernmental organization all employ cybersecurity professional the fastest increase in demand for

known a the uk cyber security forum were established supported by the government cybersecurity strategy in order to encourage startup and innovation and to address the skill gap identified by the uk government in singapore the cyber security agency ha issued a singapore operational technology ot cybersecurity competency framework otccf the framework defines emerging cybersecurity role in operational technology the otccf wa endorsed by the infocomm medium development authority imda it outline the different ot cybersecurity job position a well a the technical skill and core competency necessary it also depicts the many career path available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunity terminology the following term used with regard to computer security are explained below access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of user through the use of authentication system these system can protect either the whole computer such a through an interactive login screen or individual service such a a ftp server there are many method for identifying and authenticating user such a password identification card smart card and biometric system antivirus software consists of computer program that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer virus and other malicious software malware application are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block user the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignment to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing a few a possible they are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patch or update for them for example program can be installed into an individual user account which limit the program potential access a well a being a mean control which user have specific exception to policy in linux freebsd openbsd and other unixlike operating system there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other mean of restricting the application to it own sandbox for example linux provides namespaces and cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resource generalized security framework such a selinux or apparmor help administrator control access java and other language which compile to java byte code and run in the java virtual machine can have their access to other application controlled at the virtual machine level some software can be run in software container which can even provide their own set of system library limiting the software or anyone controlling it access to the server version of the library authentication technique can be used to ensure that communication endpoint are who they say they are automated theorem proving and other verification tool can be used to enable critical algorithm and code used in secure system to be mathematically proven to meet their specification backup are one or more copy kept of important computer file typically multiple copy will be kept at different location so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copy will still exist capability and access control list technique can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control capability v acls discus their use chain of trust technique can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded ha been certified a authentic by the system designer confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person cryptographic technique can be used to defend data in transit between system reducing the probability that the data exchange between system can be intercepted or modified cyberwarfare is an internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attack on information and information system such attack can for example disable official website and network disrupt or disable essential service steal or alter classified data and cripple financial system data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two update of a data recordencryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message cryptographically secure cipher are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible symmetrickey cipher are suitable for bulk encryption using shared key and publickey encryption using digital certificate can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance endpoint security software aid network in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry point made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected device such a laptop mobile device and usb drive firewall serve a a gatekeeper system between network allowing only traffic that match defined rule they often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention feature they are nearuniversal between company local area network and the internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rule between network if network segmentation is configured a hacker is someone who seek to breach defense and exploit weakness in a computer system or network honey pot are computer that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by cracker they can be used to catch cracker and to identify their technique intrusiondetection system are device or software application that monitor network or system for malicious activity or policy violation a microkernel is an approach to operating system design which ha only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and run other element of the operating system such a device driver protocol stack and file system in the safer le privileged user space pinging the standard ping application can be used to test if an ip address is in use if it is attacker may then try a port scan to detect which service are exposed a port scan is used to probe an ip address for open port to identify accessible network service and application a key logger is spyware that silently capture and store each keystroke that a user type on the computer keyboard social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individual to breach security logic bomb is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lie dormant until it is triggered by a specific event zero trust security mean that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resource on the network history since the internet arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent year the notion of cybersecurity ha become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal life cybersecurity and cyber threat have been consistently present for the last year of technological change in the and computer security wa mainly limited to academia until the conception of the internet where with increased connectivity computer virus and network intrusion began to take off after the spread of virus in the the marked the institutionalization of organized attack such a distributed denial of service this led to the formalization of cybersecurity a a professional disciplinethe april session organized by willis ware at the spring joint computer conference and the later publication of the ware report were foundational moment in the history of the field of computer security ware work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concernsa nist publication introduced the cia triad of confidentiality integrity and availability a a clear and simple way to describe key security goal while still relevant many more elaborate framework have since been proposedhowever in the and there were no grave computer threat because computer and the internet were still developing and security threat were easily identifiable more often threat came from malicious insider who gained unauthorized access to sensitive document and file although malware and network breach existed during the early year they did not use them for financial gain by the second half of the established computer firm like ibm started offering commercial access control system and computer security software productsone of the earliest example of an attack on a computer network wa the computer worm creeper written by bob thomas at bbn which propagated through the arpanet in the program wa purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload a later program reaper wa created by ray tomlinson in and used to destroy creeperbetween september and june a group of german hacker performed the first documented case of cyber espionage the group hacked into american defense contractor university and military base network and sold gathered information to the soviet kgb the group wa led by markus hess who wa arrested on june he wa convicted of espionage along with two coconspirator on feb in one of the first computer worm called the morris worm wa distributed via the internet it gained significant mainstream medium attentionin netscape started developing the protocol ssl shortly after the national center for supercomputing application ncsa launched mosaic the first web browser in netscape had ssl version ready in but it wa never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerability these weakness included replay attack and a vulnerability that allowed hacker to alter unencrypted communication sent by user however in february netscape launched version national security agency nsa is responsible for the protection of u information system and also for collecting foreign intelligence the agency analyzes commonly used software and system configuration to find security flaw which it can use for offensive purpose against competitor of the united statesnsa contractor created and sold clickandshoot attack tool to u agency and close ally but eventually the tool made their way to foreign adversary in nsa own hacking tool were hacked and they have been used by russia and north korea nsa employee and contractor have been recruited at high salary by adversary anxious to compete in cyberwarfare in the united state and israel began exploiting security flaw in the microsoft window operating system to attack and damage equipment

electron authent guidelin nist special public pdf archiv pdf from the origin on new nist public describ standard for ident credenti and authent system,authentication from greek authentikos real genuine from authentes author is the act of proving an assertion such a the identity of a computer system user in contrast with identification the act of indicating a person or thing identity authentication is the process of verifying that identity it might involve validating personal identity document verifying the authenticity of a website with a digital certificate determining the age of an artifact by carbon dating or ensuring that a product or document is not counterfeit method authentication is relevant to multiple field in art antique and anthropology a common problem is verifying that a given artifact wa produced by a certain person or in a certain place or period of history in computer science verifying a user identity is often required to allow access to confidential data or systemsauthentication can be considered to be of three type the first type of authentication is accepting proof of identity given by a credible person who ha firsthand evidence that the identity is genuine when authentication is required of art or physical object this proof could be a friend family member or colleague attesting to the item provenance perhaps by having witnessed the item in it creator possession with autographed sport memorabilia this could involve someone attesting that they witnessed the object being signed a vendor selling branded item implies authenticity while they may not have evidence that every step in the supply chain wa authenticated centralized authoritybased trust relationship back most secure internet communication through known public certificate authority decentralized peerbased trust also known a a web of trust is used for personal service such a email or file and trust is established by known individual signing each others cryptographic key for instance the second type of authentication is comparing the attribute of the object itself to what is known about object of that origin for example an art expert might look for similarity in the style of painting check the location and form of a signature or compare the object to an old photograph an archaeologist on the other hand might use carbon dating to verify the age of an artifact do a chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the material used or compare the style of construction or decoration to other artifact of similar origin the physic of sound and light and comparison with a known physical environment can be used to examine the authenticity of audio recording photograph or video document can be verified a being created on ink or paper readily available at the time of the item implied creation attribute comparison may be vulnerable to forgery in general it relies on the fact that creating a forgery indistinguishable from a genuine artifact requires expert knowledge that mistake are easily made and that the amount of effort required to do so is considerably greater than the amount of profit that can be gained from the forgery in art and antique certificate are of great importance for authenticating an object of interest and value certificate can however also be forged and the authentication of these pose a problem for instance the son of han van meegeren the wellknown artforger forged the work of his father and provided a certificate for it provenance a well criminal and civil penalty for fraud forgery and counterfeiting can reduce the incentive for falsification depending on the risk of getting caught currency and other financial instrument commonly use this second type of authentication method bill coin and cheque incorporate hardtoduplicate physical feature such a fine printing or engraving distinctive feel watermark and holographic imagery which are easy for trained receiver to verify the third type of authentication relies on documentation or other external affirmation in criminal court the rule of evidence often require establishing the chain of custody of evidence presented this can be accomplished through a written evidence log or by testimony from the police detective and forensics staff that handled it some antique are accompanied by certificate attesting to their authenticity signed sport memorabilia is usually accompanied by a certificate of authenticity these external record have their own problem of forgery and perjury and are also vulnerable to being separated from the artifact and lost in computer science a user can be given access to secure system based on user credential that imply authenticity a network administrator can give a user a password or provide the user with a key card or other access device to allow system access in this case authenticity is implied but not guaranteed consumer good such a pharmaceutical perfume and clothing can use all form of authentication to prevent counterfeit good from taking advantage of a popular brand reputation a mentioned above having an item for sale in a reputable store implicitly attests to it being genuine the first type of authentication the second type of authentication might involve comparing the quality and craftsmanship of an item such a an expensive handbag to genuine article the third type of authentication could be the presence of a trademark on the item which is a legally protected marking or any other identifying feature which aid consumer in the identification of genuine brandname good with software company have taken great step to protect from counterfeiter including adding hologram security ring security thread and color shifting ink authentication factor the way in which someone may be authenticated fall into three category based on what is known a the factor of authentication something the user know something the user ha and something the user is each authentication factor cover a range of element used to authenticate or verify a person identity before being granted access approving a transaction request signing a document or other work product granting authority to others and establishing a chain of authority security research ha determined that for a positive authentication element from at least two and preferably all three factor should be verified the three factor class and some of the element of each factor are knowledge something the user know eg a password partial password passphrase personal identification number pin challengeresponse the user must answer a question or pattern security question ownership something the user ha eg wrist band id card security token implanted device cell phone with a builtin hardware token software token or cell phone holding a software token inherence something the user is or doe eg fingerprint retinal pattern dna sequence there are assorted definition of what is sufficient signature face voice unique bioelectric signal or other biometric identifier singlefactor authentication a the weakest level of authentication only a single component from one of the three category of factor is used to authenticate an individual identity the use of only one factor doe not offer much protection from misuse or malicious intrusion this type of authentication is not recommended for financial or personally relevant transaction that warrant a higher level of security multifactor authentication multifactor authentication involves two or more authentication factor something you know something you have or something you are twofactor authentication is a special case of multifactor authentication involving exactly two factorsfor example using a bank card something the user ha along with a pin something the user know provides twofactor authentication business network may require user to provide a password knowledge factor and a pseudorandom number from a security token ownership factor access to a veryhighsecurity system might require a mantrap screening of height weight facial and fingerprint check several inherence factor element plus a pin and a day code knowledge factor element but this is still a twofactor authentication authentication type strong authentication the united state government national information assurance glossary defines strong authentication a a layered authentication approach relying on two or more authenticator to establish the identity of an originator or receiver of informationthe european central bank ecb ha defined strong authentication a a procedure based on two or more of the three authentication factor the factor that are used must be mutually independent and at least one factor must be nonreusable and nonreplicable except in the case of an inherence factor and must also be incapable of being stolen off the internet in the european a well a in the usamerican understanding strong authentication is very similar to multifactor authentication or but exceeding those with more rigorous requirementsthe fido alliance ha been striving to establish technical specification for strong authentication continuous authentication conventional computer system authenticate user only at the initial login session which can be the cause of a critical security flaw to resolve this problem system need continuous user authentication method that continuously monitor and authenticate user based on some biometric trait a study used behavioural biometrics based on writing style a a continuous authentication methodrecent research ha shown the possibility of using smartphones sensor and accessory to extract some behavioral attribute such a touch dynamic keystroke dynamic and gait recognition these attribute are known a behavioral biometrics and could be used to verify or identify user implicitly and continuously on smartphones the authentication system that have been built based on these behavioral biometric trait are known a active or continuous authentication system digital authentication the term digital authentication also known a electronic authentication or eauthentication refers to a group of process where the confidence for user identity is established and presented via electronic method to an information system the digital authentication process creates technical challenge because of the need to authenticate individual or entity remotely over a network the american national institute of standard and technology nist ha created a generic model for digital authentication that describes the process that are used to accomplish secure authentication enrollment an individual applies to a credential service provider csp to initiate the enrollment process after successfully proving the applicant identity the csp allows the applicant to become a subscriber authentication after becoming a subscriber the user receives an authenticator eg a token and credential such a a user name he or she is then permitted to perform online transaction within an authenticated session with a relying party where they must provide proof that he or she posse one or more authenticator lifecycle maintenance the csp is charged with the task of maintaining the user credential over the course of it lifetime while the subscriber is responsible for maintaining his or her authenticatorsthe authentication of information can pose special problem with electronic communication such a vulnerability to maninthemiddle attack whereby a third party tap into the communication stream and pose a each of the two other communicating party in order to intercept information from each extra identity factor can be required to authenticate each party identity product authentication counterfeit product are often offered to consumer a being authentic counterfeit consumer good such a electronics music apparel and counterfeit medication have been sold a being legitimate effort to control the supply chain and educate consumer help ensure that authentic product are sold and used even security printing on package label and nameplate however is subject to counterfeitingin their anticounterfeiting technology guide the euipo observatory on infringement of intellectual property right categorizes the main anticounterfeiting technology on the market currently into five main category electronic marking chemical and physical mechanical and technology for digital mediaproducts or their packaging can include a variable qr code a qr code alone is easy to verify but offer a weak level of authentication a it offer no protection against counterfeit unless scan data is analyzed at the system level to detect anomaly to increase the security level the qr code can be combined with a digital watermark or copy detection pattern that are robust to copy attempt and can be authenticated with a smartphone a secure key storage device can be used for authentication in consumer electronics network authentication license management supply chain management etc generally the device to be authenticated need some sort of wireless or wired digital connection to either a host system or a network nonetheless the component being authenticated need not be electronic in nature a an authentication chip can be mechanically attached and read through a connector to the host eg an authenticated ink tank for use with a printer for product and service that these secure coprocessors can be applied to they can offer a solution that can be much more difficult to counterfeit than most other option while at the same time being more easily verified packaging packaging and labeling can be engineered to help reduce the risk of counterfeit consumer good or the theft and resale of product some package construction are more difficult to copy and some have pilfer indicating seal counterfeit good unauthorized sale diversion material substitution and tampering can all be reduced with these anticounterfeiting technology package may include authentication seal and use security printing to help indicate that the package and content are not counterfeit these too are subject to counterfeiting package also can include antitheft device such a dyepacks rfid tag or electronic article surveillance tag that can be activated or detected by device at exit point and require specialized tool to deactivate anticounterfeiting technology that can be used with packaging include taggant fingerprinting uniquely coded microscopic material that are verified from a database encrypted microparticles unpredictably placed marking number layer and color not visible to the human eye hologram graphic printed on seal patch foil or label and used at the point of sale for visual verification microprinting secondline authentication often used on currency serialized barcodes uv printing mark only visible under uv light track and trace system use code to link product to the database tracking system water indicator become visible when contacted with water dna tracking gene embedded onto label that can be traced colorshifting ink or film visible mark that switch color or texture when tilted tamper evident seal and tape destructible or graphically verifiable at point of sale barcodes data code that can be tracked rfid chip nfc chip information content literary forgery can involve imitating the style of a famous author if an original manuscript typewritten text or recording is available then the medium itself or it packaging anything from a box to email header can help prove or disprove the authenticity of the document however text audio and video can be copied into new medium possibly leaving only the informational content itself to use in authentication various system have been invented to allow author to provide a mean for reader to reliably authenticate that a given message originated from or wa relayed by them these involve authentication factor like a difficulttoreproduce physical artifact such a a seal signature watermark special stationery or fingerprint a shared secret such a a passphrase in the content of the message an electronic signature publickey infrastructure is often used to cryptographically guarantee that a message ha been signed by the holder of a particular private keythe opposite problem is the detection of plagiarism where information from a different author is passed off a a person own work a common technique for proving plagiarism is the discovery of another copy of the same or very similar text which ha different attribution in some case excessively high quality or a style mismatch may raise suspicion of plagiarism literacy and literature authentication in literacy authentication is a reader process of questioning the veracity of an aspect of literature and then verifying those question via research the fundamental question for authentication of literature is doe one believe it related to that an authentication project is therefore a reading and writing activity in which student document the relevant research process it build student critical literacy the documentation material for literature go beyond narrative text and likely include informational text primary source and multimedia the process typically involves both internet and handson library research when authenticating historical fiction in particular reader consider the extent that the major historical event a well a the culture portrayed eg the language clothing food gender role are believable for the period history and stateoftheart historically fingerprint have been used a the most authoritative method of authentication but court case in the u and elsewhere have raised fundamental doubt about fingerprint reliability outside of the legal system a well fingerprint are easily spoofable with british telecom top computer security official noting that few fingerprint reader have not already been tricked by one spoof or another hybrid or twotiered authentication method offer a compelling the solution such a private key encrypted by fingerprint inside of a usb device in a computer data context cryptographic method have been developed which are not spoofable if the originator key ha not been compromised that the originator or anyone other than an attacker know or doesnt know about a compromise is irrelevant however it is not known whether these cryptographically based authentication method are provably secure since unanticipated mathematical development may make them vulnerable to attack in the future if that were to occur it may call into question much of the authentication in the past in particular a digitally signed contract may be questioned when a new attack on the cryptography underlying the signature is discovered authorization the process of authorization is distinct from that of authentication whereas authentication is the process of verifying that you are who you say you are authorization is the process of verifying that you are permitted to do what you are trying to do while authorization often happens immediately after authentication eg when logging into a computer system this doe not mean authorization presupposes authentication an anonymous agent could be authorized to a limited action set access control one familiar use of authentication and authorization is access control a computer system that is supposed to be used only by those authorized must attempt to detect and exclude the unauthorized access to it is therefore usually controlled

approv decis partial trust and guest will often have restrict author in order to protect resourc against improp access and usag the access polici in some oper system by default grant all consum full access to all resourc other do the opposit insist that the administr explicitli author a consum to use each resourc even when access is control through a combin of authent and access control list the

specifying access rightsprivileges to resource which is related to general information security and computer security and to access control in particular more formally to authorize is to define an access policy for example human resource staff are normally authorized to access employee record and this policy is often formalized a access control rule in a computer system during operation the system us the access control rule to decide whether access request from authenticated consumer shall be approved granted or disapproved rejected resource include individual file or an item data computer program computer device and functionality provided by computer application example of consumer are computer user computer software and other hardware on the computer overview access control in computer system and network rely on access policy the access control process can be divided into the following phase policy definition phase where access is authorized and policy enforcement phase where access request are approved or disapproved authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access request are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorization most modern multiuser operating system include rolebased access control rbac and thereby rely on authorization access control also us authentication to verify the identity of consumer when a consumer try to access a resource the access control process check that the consumer ha been authorized to use that resource authorization is the responsibility of an authority such a a department manager within the application domain but is often delegated to a custodian such a a system administrator authorization are expressed a access policy in some type of policy definition application eg in the form of an access control list or a capability or a policy administration point eg xacml on the basis of the principle of least privilege consumer should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their job older and single user operating system often had weak or nonexistent authentication and access control system anonymous consumer or guest are consumer that have not been required to authenticate they often have limited authorization on a distributed system it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity familiar example of access token include key certificate and ticket they grant access without proving identity trusted consumer are often authorized for unrestricted access to resource on a system but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision partially trusted and guest will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resource against improper access and usage the access policy in some operating system by default grant all consumer full access to all resource others do the opposite insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource even when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control list the problem of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial and often represents a much administrative burden a managing authentication credential it is often necessary to change or remove a user authorization this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rule on the system using atomic authorization is an alternative to persystem authorization management where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization

court record may also be required authority might permanently maintain the victim name a an alias for the criminal true identity in their criminal record database one problem that victim of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various data aggregator might still have incorrect criminal record in their database even after court and police record are corrected thus a future background check may return the incorrect criminal record this is just one example of the kind of impact that may continue to affect the victim of identity theft for some month or even year after the crime aside from the psychological trauma that being cloned typically engenders synthetic identity theft a variation of identity theft that ha recently become more common is synthetic identity theft in which identity are completely or partially fabricated the most common technique involves combining a real social security number with a name and birthdate other than the one that are simply associated with the number synthetic identity theft is more difficult to track a it doesnt show on either person credit report directly but may appear a an entirely new file in the credit bureau or a a subfile on one of the victim credit report synthetic identity theft primarily harm the creditor who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit individual victim can be affected if their name become confused with the synthetic identity or if negative information in their subfiles impact their credit rating medical identity theft privacy researcher pam dixon the founder of the world privacy forum coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in in the report she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victim public the report definition of the

record inaccurate information in the victim record is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctor to rely on misinformation to deliver inappropriate care after the publication of the report which contained a recommendation that consumer receive notification of medical data breach incident california passed a law requiring this and then finally hipaa wa expanded to also require medical breach notification when breach affect or more people data collected and stored by hospital and other organization such a medical aid scheme is up to time more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information child identity theft child identity theft occurs when a minor identity is used by another person for the impostor personal gain the impostor can be a family

they use to authenticate themselves to impersonate them example include rummaging through rubbish for personal information dumpster diving retrieving personal data from redundant it equipment and storage medium including pc server pda mobile phone usb memory stick and hard drive that have been disposed of carelessly at public dump site given away or sold on without having been properly sanitized using public record about individual citizen published in official register such a electoral roll stealing bank or credit card identification card passport authentication token typically by pickpocketing housebreaking or mail theft commonknowledge questioning scheme that offer account verification such a whats your mother maiden name what wa your first car model or what wa your first pet name skimming information from bank or credit card using compromised or handheld card reader and creating clone card using contactless credit card reader to acquire data wirelessly from rfidenabled passport shouldersurfing involves an individual who discreetly watch or hears others providing valuable personal information this is particularly done in crowded place because it is relatively easy to observe someone a they fill out form enter pin on atm or even type password on smartphones stealing personal information from computer using breach in browser security or malware such a trojan horse keystroke logging program or other form of spyware hacking computer network system and database to obtain personal data often in large quantity exploiting breach that result in the publication or more limited disclosure of personal information such a name address social security number or credit card number advertising bogus job offer to accumulate resume and application typically disclosing applicant name home and email address telephone number and sometimes their banking detail exploiting insider access and abusing the right of privileged it user to access personal data on their employer system infiltrating organization that store and process large amount or particularly valuable personal information impersonating trusted organization in email sm text message phone call or other form of communication to dupe victim into disclosing their personal information or login credential typically on a fake corporate website or data collection form phishing bruteforce attacking weak password and using inspired guesswork to compromise weak password reset question obtaining casting of finger for falsifying fingerprint identification browsing social networking website for personal detail published by user often using this information to appear more credible in subsequent social engineering activity diverting victim email or post to obtain personal information and credential such a credit card billing and bankcredit card statement or to delay the discovery of new account and credit agreement opened by the identity thief in the victim name using false pretense to trick individual customer service representative and help desk worker to disclose personal information and login detail or changing user passwordsaccess right pretexting stealing cheque check to acquire banking information including account number and bank code guessing social security number by using information found on internet social network such a twitter and myspace low securityprivacy protection on photo that are easily clickable and downloaded on social networking site befriending stranger on social network and taking advantage of their trust until private information is given social engineering indicator the majority of identity theft victim do not realize that they are a victim until it ha negatively impacted their life many people do not find out that their identity have been stolen until they are contacted by financial institution or discover suspicious activity on their bank account according to an article by herb weisbaum everyone in the u should assume that their personal information ha been compromised at one point it is therefore of great importance to watch out for warning sign that your identity ha been compromised the following are eleven indicator that someone else might be using your identity credit or debit card charge for good or service you are not aware of including unauthorized withdrawal from your account receiving call from credit or debit card fraud control department warning of possible suspicious activity on your credit card account receiving credit card that you did not apply for receiving information that a credit scoring investigation wa done they are often done when a loan or phone subscription wa applied for check bouncing for lack of enough money in your account to cover the amount this might be a a result of unauthorized withdrawal from your account identity theft criminal may commit crime with your personal information you may not realize this until you see the police on your door arresting you for crime that you did not commit sudden change to your credit score may indicate that someone else is using your credit card bill for service like gas water electricity not arriving in time this can be an indication that your mail wa stolen or redirected not being approved for loan because your credit report indicates that you are not credit worthy receiving notification from your post office informing you that your mail are being forwarded to another unknown address your yearly tax return indicating that you have earned more than you have actually earned this might indicate that someone is using your national identification number eg ssn to report their earnings to the tax authority individual identity protection the acquisition of personal identifier is made possible through serious breach of privacy for consumer this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credential to the identity thief eg in a phishing attack but identityrelated document such a credit card bank statement utility bill checkbook etc may also be physically stolen from vehicle home office and not the least letterboxes or directly from victim by pickpocket and bag snatcher guardianship of personal identifier by consumer is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the u federal trade commission canadian phone buster and most site that address identity theft such organization offer recommendation on how individual can prevent their information from falling into the wrong hand identity theft can be partially mitigated by not identifying oneself unnecessarily a form of information security control known a risk avoidance this implies that organization it system and procedure should not demand excessive amount of personal information or credential for identification and authentication requiring storing and processing personal identifier such a social security number national identification number driver license number credit card number etc increase the risk of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all time committing personal identifier to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risk of a wouldbe identity thief from obtaining these record to help in remembering number such a social security number and credit card number it is helpful to consider using mnemonic technique or memory aid such a the mnemonic major system identity thief sometimes impersonate dead people using personal information obtained from death notice gravestone and other source to exploit delay between the death and the closure of the person account the inattentiveness of grieving family and weakness in the process for creditchecking such crime may continue for some time until the deceased family or the authority notice and react to anomaliesin recent year commercial identity theft protectioninsurance service have become available in many country these service purport to help protect the individual from identity theft or help detect that identity theft ha occurred in exchange for a monthly or annual membership fee or premium the service typically work either by setting fraud alert on the individual credit file with the three major credit bureau or by setting up credit report monitoring with the credit bureau while identity theft protectioninsurance service have been heavily marketed their value ha been called into question potential outcome identity theft is a serious problem in the united state in a study it wa reported that million american identity had been wrongfully acquired in response under advisement from the identity theft resource center some new bill have been implemented to improve security such a requiring electronic signature and social security verificationseveral type of identity theft are used to gather information one of the most common type occurs when consumer make online purchase a study wa conducted with people to determine the relationship between the construct of fear of financial loss and reputational damage the conclusion of this study revealed that identity theft wa a positive correlation with reputable damage the relationship between perceived risk and online purchase intention were negative the significance of this study reveals that online company are more aware of the potential harm that can be done to their consumer therefore they are searching for way to reduce the perceived risk of consumer and not lose out on business victim of identity theft may face year of effort proving to the legal system that they are the true person leading to emotional strain and financial loss most identity theft is perpetrated by a family member of the victim and some may not be able to obtain new credit card or open new bank account or loan identity protection by organization in their may testimony before the united state senate the federal trade commission ftc discussed the sale of social security number and other personal identifier by creditraters and data miner the ftc agreed to the industry selfregulating principle restricting access to information on credit report according to the industry the restriction vary according to the category of customer credit reporting agency gather and disclose personal and credit information to a wide business client base poor stewardship of personal data by organization resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data can expose individual to the risk of identity theft the privacy right clearinghouse ha documented over individual data breach by u company and government agency since january which together have involved over million total record containing sensitive personal information many containing social security number poor corporate diligence standard which can result in data breach include failure to shred confidential information before throwing it into dumpster failure to ensure adequate network security credit card number stolen by call center agent and people with access to call recording the theft of laptop computer or portable medium being carried offsite containing vast amount of personal information the use of strong encryption on these device can reduce the chance of data being misused should a criminal obtain them the brokerage of personal information to other business without ensuring that the purchaser maintains adequate security control failure of government when registering sole proprietorship partnership and corporation to determine if the officer listed in the article of incorporation are who they say they are this potentially allows criminal access to personal information through credit rating and data mining servicesthe failure of corporate or government organization to protect consumer privacy client confidentiality and political privacy ha been criticized for facilitating the acquisition of personal identifier by criminalsusing various type of biometric information such a fingerprint for identification and authentication ha been cited a a way to thwart identity thief however there are technological limitation and privacy concern associated with these method a well market there is an active market for buying and selling stolen personal information which occurs mostly in darknet market but also in other black market people increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data and sell it again for a profit increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data wa stolen legal response international in march after it wa learned two passenger with stolen passport were on board malaysia airline flight which went missing on march it came to light that interpol maintains a database of million lost and stolen travel document from country which interpol make available to government and the public including airline and hotel the stolen and lost travel document sltd database however is rarely used big news network which is based in the uae reported that interpol secretarygeneral ronald k noble told a forum in abu dhabi in the previous month the bad news is that despite being incredibly costeffective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world only a handful of country are systematically using sltd to screen traveler the result is a major gap in our global security apparatus that is left vulnerable to exploitation by criminal and terrorist australia in australia each state ha enacted law that deal with different aspect of identity or fraud issue some state have now amended relevant criminal law to reflect crime of identity theft such a the criminal law consolidation act sa crime amendment fraud identity and forgery offence act and also in queensland under the criminal code qld other state and territory are in state of development in respect of regulatory framework relating to identity theft such a western australia in respect of the criminal code amendment identity crime bill at the commonwealth level under the criminal code amendment theft fraud bribery related offence act which amended certain provision within the criminal code act general dishonesty a person is

between and in australia there were fraud and deception offence an increase of from previous year the total cost reported by the attorney general department wa there are also high indirect cost associated a a direct result of an incident for example the total indirect cost for police recorded fraud is each state ha enacted it own privacy law to prevent the misuse of personal information and data the commonwealth privacy act applies only to commonwealth and territory agency and to certain privatesector body where for example they deal with sensitive record such a medical record or they have more than million in turnover pa canada under section of the criminal code everyone commits an offense who knowingly obtains or posse another person identity information in circumstance giving

site are one of the most famous spreader of poser in the online community giving the user the freedom to post any information they want without any verification that the account is being used by the real personthe philippine which rank eighth in the number of user of facebook and other social networking site such a twitter multiply and tumblr ha been known a a source of various identity theft problem identity of people who carelessly put personal information on their profile can easily be stolen just by simple browsing some people meet online get to know each other through facebook chat and exchange message that share private information others get romantically involved with online friend and end up sharing too much information such a their social security number bank account home address and company address this phenomenon lead to the creation of the cybercrime prevention act of republic act no section of this act state that it recognizes the importance of communication and multimedia for the development exploitation and dissemination of information but violator will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of but not exceeding or depending on the damage caused both sweden sweden ha had relatively few problem with identity theft because only swedish identity document were accepted for identity verification stolen document are traceable by bank and certain other institution bank are required to check the identity of anyone withdrawing money or getting loan if a bank give money to someone using an identity document that ha been reported a stolen the bank must take this loss since any eu passport is valid in sweden for identity verification and swedish passport are valid all over the eu this make it harder to detect stolen document but bank in sweden still must ensure that stolen document are not accepted other type of identity theft have become more common in sweden one common example is ordering a credit card to someone who ha an unlocked letterbox and is not home during the daytime the thief steal the letter with the credit card and the letter with the code which typically arrives a few day later usage of a stolen credit card is difficult in sweden since an identity document or a pin code is normally demanded if a shop doe not demand either it must take the loss from accepting a stolen credit card the practice of observing someone using their credit card pin code stealing the credit card or skimming it and then using the credit card ha become more common legally sweden is an open society the principle of public access state that all information eg address income tax kept by public authority must be available for anyone except in certain case for example the address of people who need to hide are restricted this make fraud easier until there were no law that specifically prohibited using someone identity instead there were only law regarding any indirect damage caused impersonating anyone else for financial gain is a type of fraud in the criminal code swedish brottsbalken impersonating anyone else to discredit them by hacking into their social medium account and provoke is considered libel however it is difficult to convict someone of committing this crime in late a new law wa introduced which partially banned undetermined identity usage united kingdom in the united kingdom personal data is protected by the data protection act the act cover all personal data which an organization may hold including name birthday and anniversary date address and telephone number under english law which extends to wale but not to northern ireland or scotland the deception offence under the theft act increasingly contend with identity theft situation in r v seward ewca crim the defendant wa acting a the frontman in the use of stolen credit card and other document to obtain good he obtained good to the value of for others who are unlikely ever to be identified the court of appeal considered a sentencing policy for deception offense involving identity theft and concluded that a prison sentence wa required henriques j said at para identity fraud is a particularly pernicious and prevalent form of dishonesty calling for in our judgment deterrent sentence statistic released by cifas uk fraud prevention service show that there were victim of identity theft in the uk in and victim in men in their and are the most common victim identity fraud now account for nearly half of all fraud recorded united state the increase in crime of identity theft led to the drafting of the identity theft and assumption deterrence act in the federal trade commission appeared before the united state senate the ftc discussed crime which exploit consumer credit to commit loan fraud mortgage fraud linesofcredit fraud credit card fraud commodity and service fraud the identity theft deterrence act amended u code title fraud related to activity in connection with identification document authentication feature and information the statute now make the possession of any mean of identification to knowingly transfer posse or use without lawful authority a federal crime alongside unlawful possession of identification document however for federal jurisdiction to prosecute the crime must include an identification document that either a is purportedly issued by the united state b is used or intended to defraud the united state c is sent through the mail or d is used in a manner that affect interstate or foreign commerce see usc punishment can be up to or year in federal prison plus fine depending on the underlying crime per usc in addition punishment for the unlawful use of a mean of identification were strengthened in aggravated identity theft allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violation a defined in through act also provides the federal trade commission with authority to track the number of incident and the dollar value of loss their figure relate mainly to consumer financial crime and not the broader range of all identificationbased crimesif charge are brought by state or local law enforcement agency different penalty apply to depend on the state six federal agency conducted a joint task force to increase the ability to detect identity theft their joint recommendation on red flag guideline is a set of requirement on financial institution and other entity which furnish credit data to credit reporting service to develop written plan for detecting identity theft the ftc ha determined that most medical practice are considered creditor and are subject to requirement to develop a plan to prevent and respond to patient identity theft these plan must be adopted by each organization board of director and monitored by senior executivesidentity theft complaint a a percentage of all fraud complaint decreased from to the federal trade commission reported that fraud complaint in general were growing faster than id theft complaint the finding were similar in two other ftc study done in and in percent of the u population said they were a victim of id theft in that number had dropped to percent of the population the commission estimate wa that identity theft accounted for some billion of loss in the preceding year alone and affected more than million american the figure comprises billion lost by business and billion lost by consumer according to the u bureau of justice statistic in of u household experienced identity theft up from in when the figure were first assembled but broadly flat since in approximately million person or of all u resident age or older reported being victim of one or more incident of identity theftat least two state california and wisconsin have created an office of privacy protection to assist their citizen in avoiding and recovering from identity theft in indiana created an identity theft unit within their office of attorney general to educate and assist consumer in avoiding and recovering from identity theft a well a assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting identity theft crimesin massachusetts in governor deval patrick committed to balancing consumer protection with the need of small business owner his office of consumer affair and business regulation announced certain adjustment to massachusetts identity theft regulation that maintain protection and also allow flexibility in compliance these updated regulation went into effect on march the regulation are clear that their approach to data security is a riskbased approach important to small business and might not handle a lot of personal information about customersthe irs ha created the irs identity protection specialized unit to help taxpayer who are victim of federal taxrelated identity theft generally the identity thief will use a stolen ssn to file a forged tax return and attempt to get a fraudulent refund early in the filing season a taxpayer will need to fill out form identity theft affidavitas for the future of medical care and medicaid people are mostly concerned about cloud computing the addition of using cloud information within the united state medicare system would institute easily accessible health information for individual but that also make it easier for identity theft currently new technology is being produced to help encrypt and protect file which will create a smooth transition to cloud technology in the healthcare system notification many state followed california lead and enacted mandatory data breach notification law a a result company that report a data breach typically report it to all their customer spread and impact survey in the u from to showed a decrease in the total number of identity fraud victim and a decrease in the total value of identity fraud from billion in to billion in the average fraud per person decreased from in to in a microsoft report show that this drop is due to statistical problem with the methodology that such surveybased estimate are hopelessly flawed and exaggerate the true loss by order of magnitudethe survey from the identity theft resource center found that only of victim find out about the theft through proactive action taken by a business the average time spent by victim resolving the problem is about hour of respondent indicated the crime involved the thief acquiring a credit cardin a widely publicized account michelle brown a victim of identity fraud testified before a u senate committee hearing on identity theft m brown testified that over a year and a half from january through july one individual impersonated me to procure over in good and service not only did she damage my credit but she escalated her crime to a level that i never truly expected she engaged in drug trafficking the crime resulted in my erroneous arrest record a warrant out for my arrest and eventually a prison record when she wa booked under my name a an inmate in the chicago federal prison in australia identity theft wa estimated to be worth between and billion per annum in the united kingdom the home office reported that identity fraud cost the uk economy billion annually expert believe that the real figure could be much higher although privacy group object to the validity of these number arguing that they are being used by the government to push for introduction of national id card confusion over exactly what constitutes identity theft ha led to claim that statistic may be exaggerated an extensively reported study from microsoft research in find that estimate of identity theft loss contain enormous

message or document a valid digital signature on a message give a recipient confidence that the message came from a sender known to the recipientdigital signature are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suite and are commonly used for software distribution financial transaction contract management software and in other case where it is important to detect forgery or tampering digital signature are often used to implement electronic signature which include any electronic data that carry the intent of a signature but not all electronic signature use digital signature electronic signature have legal significance in some country including canada south africa the united state algeria turkey india brazil indonesia mexico saudi arabia uruguay switzerland chile and the country of the european uniondigital signature employ asymmetric cryptography in many instance they provide a layer of validation and security to message sent through a nonsecure channel properly implemented a digital signature give the receiver reason to believe the message wa sent by the claimed sender digital signature are equivalent to traditional handwritten signature in many respect but properly implemented digital signature are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type digital signature scheme in the sense used here are cryptographically based and must be implemented properly to be effective they can also provide nonrepudiation meaning that the signer can not successfully claim they did not sign a message while also claiming their private key remains secret further some nonrepudiation scheme offer a timestamp for the digital signature so that even if the private key is exposed the signature is valid digitally signed message may be anything representable a a bitstring example include electronic mail contract or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol definition a digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithm a key generation algorithm that selects a private key uniformly at random from a set of possible private key the algorithm output the private key and a corresponding public key a signing algorithm that given a message and a private key produce a signature a signature verifying algorithm that given the message public key and signature either accepts or reject the message claim to authenticitytwo main property are required first the authenticity of a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key can be verified by using the corresponding public key secondly it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party private key a digital signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attach a code that act a a signature the digital signature algorithm dsa developed by the national institute of standard and technology is one of many example of a signing algorithm in the following discussion refers to a unary number formally a digital signature scheme is a triple of probabilistic polynomial time algorithm g s v satisfying g keygenerator generates a public key pk and a corresponding private key sk on input where n is the security parameter s signing return a tag t on the input the private key sk and a string x v verifying output accepted or rejected on the input the public key pk a string x and a tag tfor correctness s and v must satisfy pr pk sk v pk x ssk x accepted digital signature scheme is secure if for every nonuniform probabilistic polynomial time adversary a pr pk sk x t assk pk x q vpk x t accepted neglnwhere assk denotes that a ha access to the oracle ssk q denotes the set of the query on s made by a which know the public key pk and the security parameter n and x q denotes that the adversary may not directly query the string x on s history in whitfield diffie and martin hellman first described the notion of a digital signature scheme although they only conjectured that such scheme existed based on function that are trapdoor oneway permutation soon afterwards ronald rivest adi shamir and len adleman invented the rsa algorithm which could be used to produce primitive digital signature although only a a proofofconcept plain rsa signature are not secure the first widely marketed software package to offer digital signature wa lotus note released in which used the rsa algorithmother digital signature scheme were soon developed after rsa the earliest being lamport signature merkle signature also known a merkle tree or simply hash tree and rabin signaturesin shafi goldwasser silvio micali and ronald rivest became the first to rigorously define the security requirement of digital signature scheme they described a hierarchy of attack model for signature scheme and also presented the gmr signature scheme the first that could be proved to prevent even an existential forgery against a chosen message attack which is the currently accepted security definition for signature scheme the first such scheme which is not built on trapdoor function but rather on a family of function with a much weaker required property of oneway permutation wa presented by moni naor and moti yung method one digital signature scheme of many is based on rsa to create signature key generate an rsa key pair containing a modulus n that is the product of two random secret distinct large prime along with integer e and d such that e d mod n where is euler totient function the signer public key consists of n and e and the signer secret key contains d used directly this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to keyonly existential forgery attack to create a forgery the attacker pick a random signature and us the verification procedure to determine the message m corresponding to that signature in practice however this type of signature is not used directly but rather the message to be signed is first hashed to produce a short digest that is then padded to larger width comparable to n then signed with the reverse trapdoor function this forgery attack then only produce the padded hash function output that corresponds to but not a message that lead to that value which doe not lead to an attack in the random oracle model hashthensign an idealized version of that practice where hash and padding combined have close to n possible output this form of signature is existentially unforgeable even against a chosenplaintext attackthere are several reason to sign such a hash or message digest instead of the whole document for efficiency the signature will be much shorter and thus save time since hashing is generally much faster than signing in practice for compatibility message are typically bit string but some signature scheme operate on other domain such a in the case of rsa number modulo a composite number n a hash function can be used to convert an arbitrary input into the proper format for integrity without the hash function the text to be signed may have to be split separated in block small enough for the signature scheme to act on them directly however the receiver of the signed block is not able to recognize if all the block are present and in the appropriate order application a organization move away from paper document with ink signature or authenticity stamp digital signature can provide added assurance of the evidence to provenance identity and status of an electronic document a well a acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory the united state government printing office gpo publishes electronic version of the budget public and private law and congressional bill with digital signature university including penn state university of chicago and stanford are publishing electronic student transcript with digital signature below are some common reason for applying a digital signature to communication authentication a message may have letterhead or a handwritten signature identifying it sender but letterhead and handwritten signature can be copied and pasted onto forged message even legitimate message may be modified in transitif a bank central office receives a letter claiming to be from a branch office with instruction to change the balance of an account the central banker need to be sure before acting on the instruction that they were actually sent by a branch banker and not forgedwhether a forger fabricated the whole letter or just modified an existing letter in transit by adding some digit with a digital signature scheme the central office can arrange beforehand to have a public key on file whose private key is known only to the branch office the branch office can later sign a message and the central office can use the public key to verify the signed message wa not a forgery before acting on it a forger who doesnt know the sender private key cant sign a different message or even change a single digit in an existing message without making the recipient signature verification failencryption can hide the content of the message from an eavesdropper but encryption on it own may not let recipient verify the message authenticity or even detect selective modification like changing a digitif the bank office simply encrypted the message they exchange they could still be vulnerable to forgery in other application such a software update the message are not secretwhen a software author publishes an patch for all existing installation of the software to apply the patch itself is not secret but computer running the software must verify the authenticity of the patch before applying it lest they become victim to malware limitation replay a digital signature scheme on it own doe not prevent a valid signed message from being recorded and then maliciously reused in a replay attack for example the branch office may legitimately request that bank transfer be issued once in a signed message if the bank doesnt use a system of transaction id in their message to detect which transfer have already happened someone could illegitimately reuse the same signed message many time to drain an accountuniqueness and malleability of signature a signature itself can not be used to uniquely identify the message it signsin some signature scheme every message ha a large number of possible valid signature from the same signer and it may be easy even without knowledge of the private key to transform one valid signature into another if signature are misused a transaction id in an attempt by a banklike system such a a bitcoin exchange to detect replay this can be exploited to replay transactionsauthenticating a public key prior knowledge of a public key can be used to verify authenticity of a signed message but not the other way aroundprior knowledge of a signed message can not be used to verify authenticity of a public key in some signature scheme given a signed message it is easy to construct a public key under which the signed message will pas verification even without knowledge of the private key that wa used to make the signed message in the first place nonrepudiation nonrepudiation or more specifically nonrepudiation of origin is an important aspect of digital signature by this property an entity that ha signed some information can not at a later time deny having signed it similarly access to the public key only doe not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature note that these authentication nonrepudiation etc property rely on the secret key not having been revoked prior to it usage public revocation of a keypair is a required ability else leaked secret key would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the keypair checking revocation status requires an online check eg checking a certificate revocation list or via the online certificate status protocol very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives creditcards first checking online with the creditcard issuer to find if a given card ha been reported lost or stolen of course with stolen key pair the theft is often discovered only after the secret key use eg to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose notion of security in their foundational paper goldwasser micali and rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack model against digital signature in a keyonly attack the attacker is only given the public verification key in a known message attack the attacker is given valid signature for a variety of message known by the attacker but not chosen by the attacker in an adaptive chosen message attack the attacker first learns signature on arbitrary message of the attacker choicethey also describe a hierarchy of attack result a total break result in the recovery of the signing key a universal forgery attack result in the ability to forge signature for any message a selective forgery attack result in a signature on a message of the adversary choice an existential forgery merely result in some valid messagesignature pair not already known to the adversarythe strongest notion of security therefore is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack additional security precaution putting the private key on a smart card all public key private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret a private key can be stored on a user computer and protected by a local password but this ha two disadvantage the user can only sign document on that particular computer the security of the private key depends entirely on the security of the computera more secure alternative is to store the private key on a smart card many smart card are designed to be tamperresistant although some design have been broken notably by ross anderson and his student in a typical digital signature implementation the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card whose cpu sign the hash using the stored private key of the user and then return the signed hash typically a user must activate their smart card by entering a personal identification number or pin code thus providing twofactor authentication it can be arranged that the private key never leaf the smart card although this is not always implemented if the smart card is stolen the thief will still need the pin code to generate a digital signature this reduces the security of the scheme to that of the pin system although it still requires an attacker to posse the card a mitigating factor is that private key if generated and stored on smart card are usually regarded a difficult to copy and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy thus the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked private key that are protected by software only may be easier to copy and such compromise are far more difficult to detect using smart card reader with a separate keyboard entering a pin code to activate the smart card commonly requires a numeric keypad some card reader have their own numeric keypad this is safer than using a card reader integrated into a pc and then entering the pin using that computer keyboard reader with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a keystroke logger potentially compromising the pin code specialized card reader are also le vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often certified other smart card design smart card design is an active field and there are smart card scheme which are intended to avoid these particular problem despite having few security proof so far using digital signature only with trusted application one of the main difference between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user doe not see what they sign the user application present a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key an attacker who gain control of the user pc can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute in effect replacing the user own communication with those of the attacker this could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the user original onscreen but presenting the attacker own document to the signing application to protect against this scenario an authentication system can be set up between the user application word processor email client etc and the signing application the general idea is to provide some mean for both the user application and signing application to verify each others integrity for example the signing application may require all request to come from digitally signed binary using a network attached hardware security module one of the main difference between a cloud based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk many risk averse company including government financial and medical institution and payment processor require more secure standard like fips level and fips certification to ensure the signature is validated and secure wysiwys technically speaking a digital signature applies to a string of bit whereas human and application believe that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bit in order to be semantically interpreted the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for human and application and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based process on a computer system the problem is that the semantic interpretation of bit can change a a function of the process used to transform the bit into semantic content it is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing change on the computer system where the document is being processed from a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly ha been signed wysiwys what you see is what you sign mean that the semantic interpretation of a signed message can not be changed in particular this also mean that a message can not contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of and that can be revealed after the signature ha been applied wysiwys is a requirement for the validity of digital signature but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer system the term wysiwys wa coined by peter landrock and torben pedersen to describe some of the principle in delivering secure and legally binding digital signature for paneuropean project digital signature versus ink on paper signature an ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally but to have credible signature copy that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill and to produce ink signature copy that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult digital signature cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature can not be copied to another document paper contract sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page and the previous page may be replaced after a signature is applied digital signature can be applied to an entire document such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the page have been altered but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all page of the contract some digital signature algorithm rsa dsa ecdsa eddsa rsa with sha ecdsa with sha

possible to aggregate all these signature into a single signature whose size is constant in the number of user this single signature will convince the verifier that the n user did indeed sign the n original message a scheme by mihir bellare and gregory neven may be used with bitcoin signature with efficient protocol are signature scheme that facilitate efficient cryptographic protocol such a zeroknowledge proof or secure computation the current state of use legal and practical most digital signature scheme share the following goal regardless of cryptographic theory or legal provision quality algorithm some publickey algorithm are known to be insecure a practical attack against them have been discovered quality implementation an implementation of a good algorithm or protocol with mistake will not work user and their software must carry out the signature protocol properly the private key must remain private if the private key becomes known to any other party that party can produce perfect digital signature of anything the public key owner must be verifiable a public key associated with bob actually came from bob this is commonly done using a public key infrastructure pki and the public keyuser association is attested by the operator of the pki called a certificate authority for open pkis in which anyone can request such an attestation universally embodied in a cryptographically protected public key certificate the possibility of mistaken attestation is nontrivial commercial pki operator have suffered several publicly known problem such mistake could lead to falsely signed and thus wrongly attributed document closed pki system are more expensive but le easily subverted in this wayonly if all of these condition are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message and therefore of their assent to it content legal enactment can not change this reality of the existing engineering possibility though some such have not reflected this actuality legislature being importuned by business expecting to profit from operating a pki or by the technological avantgarde advocating new solution to old problem have enacted statute andor regulation in many jurisdiction authorizing endorsing encouraging or permitting digital signature and providing for or limiting their legal effect the first appears to have been in utah in the united state followed closely by the state massachusetts and california other country have also passed statute or issued regulation in this area a well and the un ha had an active model law project for some time these enactment or proposed enactment vary from place to place have typically embodied expectation at variance optimistically or pessimistically with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering and have had the net effect of confusing potential user and specifier nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable adoption of technical standard for digital signature have lagged behind much of the legislation delaying a more or le unified engineering position on interoperability algorithm choice key length and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide industry standard some industry have established common interoperability standard for the use of digital signature between member of the industry and with regulator these include the automotive network exchange for the automobile industry and the safebiopharma association for the healthcare industry using separate key pair for signing and encryption in several country a digital signature ha a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature a in the eu digital signature directive and eu followon legislation generally these provision mean that anything digitally signed legally bind the signer of the document to the term therein for that reason it is often thought best to use separate key pair for encrypting and signing using the encryption key pair a person can engage in an encrypted conversation eg regarding a real estate transaction but the encryption doe not legally sign every message he or she sends only when both party come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing key and only then are they legally bound by the term of a specific document after signing the document can be sent over the encrypted link if a signing key is lost or

attack may become a normal part of future warfare among nationstates military commander see a need to develop cyberspace operation computer a a tool when an individual is the target of cybercrime the computer is often the tool rather than the target these crime which typically exploit human weakness usually do not require much technical expertise these are the type of crime which have existed for century in the offline world criminal have simply been given a tool that increase their pool of potential victim and make them all the harder to trace and apprehendcrimes that use computer network or device to advance other end include fraud and identity theft although this increasingly us malware hacking or phishing making it an example of computer a target a well a computer a tool information warfare phishing scam spam propagation of illegal obscene or offensive content including harassment and threatsthe unsolicited sending of bulk email for commercial purpose spam is unlawful in some jurisdiction phishing is mostly propagated via email phishing email may contain link to other website that are affected by malware or they may contain link to fake online banking or other website used to steal private account information obscene or offensive content the content of website and other electronic communication may be distasteful obscene or offensive for a variety of reason in some instance it may be illegal what content is unlawful varies greatly between country and even within nation it is a sensitive area in which the court can become involved in arbitrating between group with strong belief one area of internet pornography that ha been the target of the strongest effort at curtailment is child pornography which is illegal in most jurisdiction in the world adfraud adfrauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals a such fraud are lucrative and unlikely to be prosecuted jeanloup richet a professor at the sorbonne business school classified the large variety of adfrauds committed by cybercriminals into three category identity fraud attribution fraud and adfraud servicesidentity fraud aim to impersonate real user and inflate audience number the technique used for identity fraud include traffic from bot coming from a hosting company a data center or compromised device cookie stuffing falsification of user characteristic such a location and browser type fake social traffic misleading user on social network into visiting the advertised website and fake social medium account that make a bot appear legitimate attribution fraud impersonates the activity of real user such a click and conversation many adfraud technique belong to this category the use of hijacked and malwareinfected device a part of a botnet click farm company where lowwage employee are paid to click or engage in conversation incentivized browsing video placement abuse delivered in display banner slot hidden ad which will never be viewed by real user domain spoofing ad served on a fake website and clickjacking in which the user is forced to click on an ad adfraud service include all online infrastructure and hosting service that might be needed to undertake identity or attribution fraud service can involve the creation of spam website fake network of website that provide artificial backlinks link building service hosting service or fake and scam page impersonating a famous brand online harassment whereas content may be offensive in a nonspecific way harassment directs obscenity and derogatory comment at specific individual often focusing on gender race religion nationality or sexual orientation committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence for example in the case of united state v neil scott kramer the defendant wa given an enhanced sentence according to the u sentencing guideline manual for his use of a cell phone to persuade induce entice coerce or facilitate the travel of the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct kramer appealed the sentence on the ground that there wa insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer although kramer tried to argue this point the u sentencing guideline manual state that the term computer mean an electronic magnetic optical electrochemical or other highspeed data processing device performing logical arithmetic or storage function and includes any data storage facility or communication facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device in the united state at least state have passed law and regulation that regard extreme online harassment a a criminal act these act can also be prosecuted on the federal level because of u code section which state that using computer to threaten or harass can lead to a sentence of up to yearsseveral country besides the u have also created law to combat online harassment in china a country with over percent of the world internet user in response to the human flesh search engine bullying incident the legislative affair office of the state council passed a strict law against cyberbullying the united kingdom passed the malicious communication act which state that sending message or letter electronically that the government deems indecent or grossly offensive andor language intended to cause distress and anxiety can lead to a prison sentence of six month and a potentially large fine australia while not directly addressing the issue of harassment includes most form of online harassment under the criminal code act of using telecommunication to send threat harass or cause offense is a direct violation of this actalthough freedom of speech is protected by law in most democratic society it doe not include all type of speech spoken or written threat can be criminalized because they harm or intimidate this applies to online or networkrelated threat cyberbullying ha increased drastically with the growing popularity of online social networking a of january percent of adult internet user in the united state had personally experienced online harassment online harassment of child often ha negative and even lifethreatening effect according to a survey percent of child develop social anxiety percent develop depression and percent have suicidal thoughtsthe united arab emirate wa found to have purchased the nso group mobile spyware pegasus for mass surveillance and a campaign of harassment of prominent activist and journalist including ahmed mansoor princess latifa princess haya and others ghada oueiss wa one of the many highprofile female journalist and activist who were targeted she filed a lawsuit against uae ruler mohamed bin zayed al nahyan along with other defendant accusing them of sharing her photo online drug trafficking darknet market are used to buy and sell recreational drug online some drug trafficker use encrypted messaging tool to communicate with drug mule or potential customer the dark web site silk road which started operation in wa the first major online marketplace for drug it wa permanently shut down in by the fbi and europol after silk road went down silk road reloaded emerged however it wa just an older marketplace named diabolus market that used the silk road name in order to get more exposure from the silk road brand earlier successdarknet market have had a rise in traffic in recent year for many reason such a the anonymous purchase and often a system of review by other buyer there are many way in which darknet market can financially drain individual vendor and customer alike go to great length to keep their identity a secret while online commonly used tool for hiding their online presence include virtual private network vpns tail and the tor browser darknet market entice customer by making them feel comfortable although people can easily gain access to a tor browser actually gaining access to an illicit market is not a simple a typing it in on a search engine a one would with google darknet market have special link that change frequently ending in onion a opposed to the typical com net and org domain extension to add to privacy the most prevalent currency on these market is bitcoin which allows transaction to be anonymousa problem that marketplace user sometimes face is exit scamming that is a vendor with a high rating act a if they are selling on the market and have user pay for product they never receive the vendor then close their account after receiving money from multiple buyer and never sending what wa paid for the vendor all of whom are involved in illegal activity have no reason not to engage in exit scamming when they no longer want to be a vendor in an entire market known a wall street market allegedly exit scammed stealing million dollar in bitcointhe fbi ha cracked down on these market in july the fbi seized one of the biggest market commonly called alphabay which reopened in august under the control of desnake one of the original administrator investigator pose a buyer and order product from darknet vendor in the hope that the vendor leave a trail the investigator can follow in one case an investigator posed a a firearm seller and for six month people purchased from them and provided home address the fbi wa able to make over a dozen arrest during this sixmonth investigation another crackdown targeted vendor selling fentanyl and opiate with thousand of people dying each year due to drug overdose investigator have made internet drug sale a priority many vendor do not realize the extra criminal charge that go along with selling drug online such a money laundering and illegal use of the mail in a vendor wa sentenced to year in prison after selling cocaine and methamphetamine under the name jetsetlife but despite the large amount of time investigator spend tracking down people in only suspect who bought and sold illegal good on some of the biggest market were identified meanwhile thousand of transaction take place daily on these market notable incident one of the highestprofile banking computer crime occurred over a course of three year beginning in the chief teller at the park avenue branch of new york union dime saving bank embezzled over million from hundred of account a hacking group called mod master of deception allegedly stole password and technical data from pacific bell nynex and other telephone company a well a several big credit agency and two major university the damage caused wa extensive one company southwestern bell suffered loss of in a ucla student used his pc to break into a defense department international communication system between and the newscorp satellite paytoview encrypted skytv service wa hacked several time during an ongoing technological arm race between a paneuropean hacking group and newscorp the original motivation of the hacker wa to watch star trek rerun in germany which wa something which newscorp did not have the copyright permission to allow on march the melissa worm infected a document on a victim computer then automatically emailed that document and a copy of the virus to other people in february an individual going by the alias of mafiaboy began a series of denialofservice attack against highprofile website including yahoo dell inc etrade ebay and cnn about computer at stanford university along with computer at the university of california at santa barbara were among the zombie computer sending ping in the distributed denialofservice attack on august canadian federal prosecutor charged mafiaboy with count of illegal access to computer the stuxnet worm corrupted scada microprocessor particularly the type used in siemens centrifuge controller the russian business network rbn wa registered a an internet site in initially much of it activity wa legitimate but apparently the founder soon discovered that it wa more profitable to host illegitimate activity and to offer it service to criminal the rbn ha been described by verisign a the baddest of the bad it provides web hosting service and internet access to all kind of criminal and objectionable activity that earn up to million in one year it specializes in personal identity theft for resale it is the originator of mpack and an alleged operator of the now defunct storm botnet on march spanish investigator arrested three men suspected of infecting over million computer around the world the botnet of infected computer included pc inside more than half of the fortune company and more than major bank according to investigator in august the u department of homeland security shut down the international pedophile ring dreamboard the website had approximately member and may have distributed up to terabyte of child pornography roughly equivalent to dvd to date this is the single largest u prosecution of an international child pornography ring arrest were made worldwide in january zapposcom experienced a security breach compromising the credit card number personal information and billing and shipping address of a many a million customer in june linkedin and eharmony were attacked and million password hash were compromised thirty thousand password were cracked and million eharmony password were posted online in december the well fargo website experienced a denialofservice attack that potentially compromised million customer and million active viewer other bank thought to be compromised included bank of america j p morgan u bank and pnc financial service on april the twitter account of the associated press wa hacked the hacker posted a hoax tweet about fictitious attack on the white house that they claimed left thenpresident obama injured the hoax tweet resulted in a brief plunge of point in the dow jones industrial average the removal of billion from the sp index and the temporary suspension of aps twitter account the dow jones later restored it session gain in may country logged a ransomware cybercrime called wannacry illicit access to camera sensor microphone sensor phonebook contact all internetenabled apps and metadata of mobile telephone running android and io wa reportedly provided by israeli spyware that wa found to be in operation in at least nationstates around the world journalist royalty and government official were among the target earlier accusation that israeli weapon company were meddling in international telephony and smartphones have been eclipsed by the pegasus spyware revelation in december u intelligence official and the new york time revealed that totok a messaging application widely used in the united arab emirate is a spying tool for the uae an investigation revealed that the emirati government wa attempting to track every conversation movement relationship appointment sound and image of those who installed the app on their phone combating computer crime due to cybercriminals using the internet for crossborder attack and crime the process of prosecuting cybercriminals ha been difficult the number of vulnerability that a cybercriminal ha an opportunity ha to exploit ha also increased over the year from to alone there ha been a increase in vulnerability across all online device the internet expansive reach cause the damage inflicted to people to be magnified since many method of cybercrime have the opportunity to reach many people the availability of virtual space ha allowed cybercrime to become an everyday occurrence in the internet crime complaint center received complaint of cybercrime which led to billion lost investigation in a criminal investigation a computer can be a source of evidence see digital forensics even when a computer is not directly used for criminal purpose it may contain record of value to criminal investigator in the form of a logfile in many country internet service provider are required by law to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time there are many way for cybercrime to take place and investigation tend to start with an ip address trace however that doe not necessarily enable detective to solve a case different type of hightech crime may also include element of lowtech crime and vice versa making cybercrime investigator an indispensable part of modern law enforcement method of cybercrime detective work are dynamic and constantly improving whether in closed police unit or in the framework of international cooperation in the united state the fbi and the department of homeland security dhs are government agency that combat cybercrime the fbi ha trained agent and analyst in cybercrime placed in their field office and headquarters in the dhs the secret service ha a cyber intelligence section that work to target financial cybercrime they combat international cybercrime and work to protect institution such a bank from intrusion and information breach based in alabama the secret service and the alabama office of prosecution service work together to train professional in law enforcement at the national computer forensic institute the ncfi provides state and local member of the law enforcement community with training in cyber incident response investigation and forensic examination in cyber incident response investigation and forensic examinationbecause cybercriminals commonly use encryption and other technique to hide their identity and location it can be difficult to trace a perpetrator after a crime is committed so prevention measure are crucial prevention the department of homeland security also instituted the continuous diagnostics and mitigation cdm program the cdm program monitor and secures government network by tracking network risk and informing system personnel so that they can take action in an attempt to catch intrusion before the damage is done the dhs created the enhanced cybersecurity service ec the cyber security and infrastructure security agency approves the private partner that provide intrusion detection and prevention service through the ecscybersecurity professional have been skeptical of preventionfocused strategy the mode of use of cybersecurity product ha also been called into question shuman ghosemajumder ha argued that individual company using a combination of product for security is not a scalable approach and ha advocated for the use of cybersecurity technology primarily at the platform levelon a personal level there are some strategy available to defend against cybercrime keeping your software and operating system update to benefit from security patch using antivirus software that can detect and remove malicious threat use strong password with a variety of character that arent easy to guess refrain from opening attachment from spam email do not click on link from spam email do not give out personal information over the internet unless you can verify that the destination is safe contact company about suspicious request of your information legislation because of weak law cybercriminals operating from developing country can often evade detection and prosecution in country such a the philippine law against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent cybercriminals can then strike from across international border and remain undetected even when identified these criminal can typically avoid being extradited to a country such a the u that ha law that allow for prosecution for this reason agency such a the fbi have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminal for example two russian hacker had been evading the fbi for some time the fbi set up a fake computing company based in seattle washington they proceeded to lure the two russian men into the united state by offering them work with this company upon completion of the interview the suspect were arrested clever trick like that are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak law and limited international cooperation make it impossible otherwisein april thenpresident barack obama released an executive order that allows the u to freeze the asset of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the united statesthe european union adopted cybercrime directive which wa elaborated upon in the council of europe convention on cybercrimeit is not only the u and the european union that have been introducing measure against cybercrime on may china announced that it new cybersecurity law wa taking effectin australia legislation to combat cybercrime includes the criminal code act the telecommunication act and the enhancing online safety act penalty penalty for computerrelated crime in new york state can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a class a misdemeanor such a unauthorized use of a computer up to to year in prison for a class c felony such a computer tampering in the first degreehowever some former cybercriminals have been hired a information security expert by private company due to their inside knowledge of computer crime a phenomenon which theoretically could create perverse incentive a possible counter to this is for court to ban convicted hacker from using the internet or computer even after they have been released from prison though a computer and the internet become more and more central to everyday life this type of punishment becomes more and more draconian nuanced approach have been developed that manage cyber offender behavior without resorting to total computer or internet ban these approach involve restricting individual to specific device which are subject to monitoring or search by probation or parole officer awareness cybercrime is becoming more of a threat in our society according to accentures state of cybersecurity security attack increased from to the number of attack per company increased from to due to this rising threat the importance of raising awareness about measure to protect information and the tactic criminal use to steal that information is paramount however despite cybercrime becoming a mounting problem many people are not aware of the severity of this problem this could be attributed to a lack of experience and knowledge of technological issue there are million cyberattacks annually which mean that there are over attack a day attack every hour or nearly three attack every minute with study showing that only percent of victim had asked the people who were carrying out the attack to stop anybody who us the internet for any reason can be a victim which is why it is important to be aware of how to be protected while online intelligence a cybercrime proliferated a professional ecosystem evolved to support individual and group seeking to profit from cybercrime activity the ecosystem ha become quite specialized and includes malware developer botnet operator professional cybercrime group group specializing in the sale of stolen content and so forth a few of the leading cybersecurity company have the skill and resource to follow the activity of these individual and group a wide variety of information that can be used for defensive purpose is available from these source for example technical indicator such a hash of infected file and malicious ipsurls a well a strategic information profiling the goal and technique of the profiled group much of it is freely available but consistent ongoing access typically requires a subscription some in the corporate sector see a crucial role for artificial intelligence in the future development of cybersecurityinterpols cyber fusion center began a collaboration with key cybersecurity player to distribute information on the latest online scam cyber threat and risk to internet user since report on social engineering fraud ransomware phishing and other attack have been distributed to security agency in over country spread of cybercrime the increasing prevalence of cybercrime ha resulted in more attention to computer crime detection and prosecution hacking ha become le complex a hacking community disseminate their knowledge through the internet blog and social network have contributed substantially to information sharing so that beginner can benefit from older hacker knowledge and advice furthermore hacking is cheaper than ever before the cloud computing era in order to spam or scam one needed a variety of resource such a a dedicated server skill in server management network configuration and network maintenance and knowledge of internet service provider standard by comparison a softwareasaservice for mail is a scalable and inexpensive bulk emailsending service for marketing purpose that could be easily set up for spam cloud computing could help cybercriminals

pentest or ethical hacking is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system performed to evaluate the security of the system this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment the test is performed to identify weakness or vulnerability including the potential for unauthorized party to gain access to the system feature and data a well a strength enabling a full risk assessment to be completed the process typically identifies the target system and a particular goal then review available information and undertakes various mean to attain that goal a penetration test target may be a white box about which background and system information are provided in advance to the tester or a black box about which only basic information other than the company name is provided a gray box penetration test is a combination of the two where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor a penetration test can help identify a system vulnerability to attack and estimate how vulnerable it issecurity issue that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner penetration test report may also ass potential impact to the organization and suggest countermeasure to reduce the riskthe uk national cyber security center describes penetration testing a a method for gaining assurance in the security of an it system by attempting to breach some or all of that system security using the same tool and technique a an adversary mightthe goal of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved activity for any given engagement with the primary goal focused on finding vulnerability that could be exploited by a nefarious actor and informing the client of those vulnerability along with recommended mitigation strategiespenetration test are a component of a full security audit for example the payment card industry data security standard requires penetration testing on a regular schedule and after system change penetration testing also can support risk assessment a outlined in the nist risk management framework sp standard framework and methodology exist for conducting penetration test these include the open source security testing methodology manual osstmm the penetration testing execution standard ptes the nist special publication the information system security assessment framework issaf and the owasp testing guide crest a not for profit professional body for the technical cyber security industry provides it crest defensible penetration test standard that provides the industry with guidance for commercially reasonable assurance activity when carrying out penetration test flaw hypothesis methodology is a system analysis and penetration prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaw in a software system are compiled through analysis of the specification and documentation for the system the list of hypothesized flaw is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise the prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system there are different type of penetration testing depending upon the goal of the organization which include network external and internal wireless web application social engineering and remediation verification history by the mid growing popularity of timesharing computer system that made resource accessible over communication line created new security concern a the scholar deborah russell and g t gangemi sr explain the marked the true beginning of the age of computer security in june for example several of the us leading computer security expert held one of the first major conference on system securityhosted by the government contractor the system development corporation sdc during the conference someone noted that one sdc employee had been able to easily undermine various system safeguard added to sdcs timesharing computer system in hope that further system security study would be useful attendee requested study to be conducted in such area a breaking security protection in the timeshared system in other word the conference participant initiated one of the first formal request to use computer penetration a a tool for studying system security at the spring joint computer conference many leading computer specialist again met to discus system security concern during this conference the computer security expert willis ware harold petersen and rein turn all of the rand corporation and bernard peter of the national security agency nsa all used the phrase penetration to describe an attack against a computer system in a paper ware referred to the military remotely accessible timesharing system warning that deliberate attempt to penetrate such computer system must be anticipated his colleague petersen and turn shared the same concern observing that online communication system are vulnerable to threat to privacy including deliberate penetration bernard peter of the nsa made the same point insisting that computer input and output could provide large amount of information to a penetrating program during the conference computer penetration would become formally identified a a major threat to online computer system the threat that computer penetration posed wa next outlined in a major report organized by the united state department of defense dod in late essentially dod official turned to willis ware to lead a task force of expert from nsa cia dod academia and industry to formally ass the security of timesharing computer system by relying on many paper presented during the spring joint computer conference the task force largely confirmed the threat to system security that computer penetration posed ware report wa initially classified but many of the country leading computer expert quickly identified the study a the definitive document on computer security jeffrey r yost of the charles babbage institute ha more recently described the ware report a by far the most important and thorough study on technical and operational issue regarding secure computing system of it time period in effect the ware report reaffirmed the major threat posed by computer penetration to the new online timesharing computer system to better understand system weakness the federal government and it contractor soon began organizing team of penetrator known a tiger team to use computer penetration to test system security deborah russell and g t gangemi sr stated that during the tiger team first emerged on the computer scene tiger team were government and industrysponsored team of cracker who attempted to break down the defense of computer system in an effort to uncover and eventually patch security hole a leading scholar on the history of computer security donald mackenzie similarly point out that rand had done some penetration study experiment in circumventing computer security control of early timesharing system on behalf of the government jeffrey r yost of the charles babbage institute in his own work on the history of computer security also acknowledges that both the rand corporation and the sdc had engaged in some of the first socalled penetration study to try to infiltrate timesharing system in order to test their vulnerability in virtually all these early study tiger team successfully broke into all targeted computer system a the country timesharing system had poor defense of early tiger team action effort at the rand corporation demonstrated the usefulness of penetration a a tool for assessing system security at the time one rand analyst noted that the test had demonstrated the practicality of systempenetration a a tool for evaluating the effectiveness and adequacy of implemented data security safeguard in addition a number of the rand analyst insisted that the penetration test exercise all offered several benefit that justified it continued use a they noted in one paper a penetrator seems to develop a diabolical frame of mind in his search for operating system weakness and incompleteness which is difficult to emulate for these reason and others many analyst at rand recommended the continued study of penetration technique for their usefulness in assessing system security presumably the leading computer penetration expert during these formative year wa james p anderson who had worked with the nsa rand and other government agency to study system security in the early the u air force contracted anderson private company to study the security of it timesharing system at the pentagon in his study anderson outlined a number of major factor involved in computer penetration anderson described a general attack sequence in step find an exploitable vulnerability design an attack around it test the attack seize a line in use enter the attack exploit the entry for information recoveryover time anderson description of general computer penetration step helped guide many other security expert who relied on this technique to ass timesharing computer system security in the following year computer penetration a a tool for security assessment became more refined and sophisticated in the early the journalist william broad briefly summarized the ongoing effort of tiger team to ass system security a broad reported the dodsponsored report by willis ware had showed how spy could actively penetrate computer steal or copy electronic file and subvert the device that normally guard topsecret information the study touched off more than a decade of quiet activity by elite group of computer scientist working for the government who tried to break into sensitive computer they succeeded in every attemptwhile these various study may have suggested that computer security in the u remained a major problem the scholar edward hunt ha more recently made a broader point about the extensive study of computer penetration a a security tool hunt suggests in a recent paper on the history of penetration testing that the defense establishment ultimately created many of the tool used in modern day cyberwarfare a it carefully defined and researched the many way that computer penetrator could hack into targeted system tool a wide variety of security assessment tool are available to assist with penetration testing including freeofcharge free software and commercial software specialized o distribution several operating system distribution are geared towards penetration testing such distribution typically contain a prepackaged and preconfigured set of tool the penetration tester doe not have to hunt down each individual tool which might increase the risk of complicationssuch a compile error dependency issue and configuration error also acquiring additional tool may not be practical in the tester context notable penetration testing o example include blackarch based on arch linux backbox based on ubuntu kali linux replaced backtrack december based on debian parrot security o based on debian pentoo based on gentoo whax based on slackwaremany other specialized operating system facilitate penetration testingeach more or le dedicated to a specific field of penetration testing a number of linux distribution include known o and application vulnerability and can be deployed a target to practice against such system help new security professional try the latest security tool in a lab environment example include damn vulnerable linux dvl the owasp web testing environment wtw and metasploitable software framework backbox hping metasploit project nessus nmap owasp zap saint burp suite wireshark john the ripper hashcat penetration testing phase the process of penetration testing may be simplified into the following five phase reconnaissance the act of gathering important information on a target system this information can be used to better attack the target for example open source search engine can be used to find data that can be used in a social engineering attack scanning us technical tool to further the attacker knowledge of the system for example nmap can be used to scan for open port gaining access using the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phase the attacker can use a payload to exploit the targeted system for example metasploit can be used to automate attack on known vulnerability maintaining access maintaining access requires taking the step involved in being able to be persistently within the target environment in order to gather a much data a possible covering track the attacker must clear any trace of compromising the victim system any type of data gathered log event in order to remain anonymousonce an attacker ha exploited one vulnerability they may gain access to other machine so the process repeat ie they look for new vulnerability and attempt to exploit them this process is referred to a pivoting vulnerability legal operation that let the tester execute an illegal operation include unescaped sql command unchanged hashed password in sourcevisible project human relationship and old hashing or cryptographic function a single flaw may not be enough to enable a critically serious exploit leveraging multiple known flaw and shaping the payload in a way that appears a a valid operation is almost always required metasploit provides a ruby library for common task and maintains a database of known exploit when working under budget and time constraint fuzzing is a common technique that discovers vulnerability it aim to get an unhandled error through random input the tester us random input to access the le often used code path welltrodden code path are usually free of error error are useful because they either expose more information such a http server crash with full info tracebacksor are directly usable such a buffer overflow imagine a website ha text input box a few are vulnerable to sql injection on certain string submitting random string to those box for a while will hopefully hit the bugged code path the error show itself a a broken html page half rendered because of an sql error in this case only text box are treated a input stream however software system have many possible input stream such a cookie and session data the uploaded file stream rpc channel or memory error can happen in any of these input stream the test goal is to first get an unhandled error and then understand the flaw based on the failed test case tester write an automated tool to test their understanding of the flaw until it is correct after that it may become obvious how to package the payload so that the target system trigger it execution if this is not viable one can hope that another error produced by the fuzzer yield more fruit the use of a fuzzer save time by not checking adequate code path where exploit are unlikely payload the illegal operation or payload in metasploit terminology can include function for logging keystroke taking screenshots installing adware stealing credential creating backdoor using shellcode or altering data some company maintain large database of known exploit and provide product that automatically test target system for vulnerability metasploit nessus nmap openvas standardized government penetration test service the general service administration gsa ha

biometric identifier are often categorized a physiological characteristic which are related to the shape of the body example include but are not limited to fingerprint palm vein face recognition dna

control include tokenbased identification system such a a driver license or passport and knowledgebased identification system such a a password or personal identification number since biometric identifier are unique to individual they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledgebased method however the collection of biometric identifier raise privacy concern about the ultimate use of this information biometric functionality many different aspect of human physiology chemistry or behavior can be used for biometric authentication the selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factor jain et al identified seven such factor to be used when assessing the suitability of any trait for use in biometric authentication biometric authentication is based upon biometric recognition which is an advanced method of recognising biological and behavioural characteristic of an individual universality mean that every person using a system should posse the trait uniqueness mean the trait should be sufficiently different for individual in the relevant population such that they can be distinguished from one another permanence relates to the manner in which a trait varies over time more specifically a trait with good permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching algorithm measurability collectability relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait in addition acquired data should be in a form that permit subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature set performance relates to the accuracy speed and robustness of technology used see performance section for more detail acceptability relates to how well individual in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substituteproper biometric use is very application dependent certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required level of convenience and security no single biometric will meet all the requirement of every possible application the block diagram illustrates the two basic mode of a biometric system first in verification or authentication mode the system performs a onetoone comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be three step are involved in the verification of a person in the first step reference model for all the user are generated and stored in the model database in the second step some sample are matched with reference model to generate the genuine and impostor score and calculate the threshold the third step is the testing step this process may use a smart card username or id number eg pin to indicate which template should be used for comparison positive recognition is a common use of the verification mode where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identitysecond in identification mode the system performs a onetomany comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual the system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the database fall within a previously set threshold identification mode can be used either for positive recognition so that the user doe not have to provide any information about the template to be used or for negative recognition of the person where the system establishes whether the person is who she implicitly or explicitly denies to be the latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other method of personal recognition such a password pin or key are ineffective the first time an individual us a biometric system is called enrollment during enrollment biometric information from an individual is captured and stored in subsequent us biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such system themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust the first block sensor is the interface between the real world and the system it ha to acquire all the necessary data most of the time it is an image acquisition system but it can change according to the characteristic desired the second block performs all the necessary preprocessing it ha to remove artifact from the sensor to enhance the input eg removing background noise to use some kind of normalization etc in the third block necessary feature are extracted this step is an important step a the correct feature need to be extracted in an optimal way a vector of number or an image with particular property is used to create a template a template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristic extracted from the source element of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the file size and to protect the identity of the enrollee however depending on the scope of the biometric system original biometric image source may be retained such a the pivcards used in the federal information processing standard personal identity verification piv of federal employee and contractor fips the enrollment phase the template is simply stored somewhere on a card or within a database or both during the matching phase the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compare it with other existing template estimating the distance between them using any algorithm eg hamming distance the matching program will analyze the template with the input this will then be output for a specified use or purpose eg entrance in a restricted area though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep selection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurement and user requirement in selecting a particular biometric factor to consider include performance social acceptability ease of circumvention andor spoofing robustness population coverage size of equipment needed and identity theft deterrence the selection of a biometric is based on user requirement and considers sensor and device availability computational time and reliability cost sensor size and power consumption multimodal biometric system multimodal biometric system use multiple sensor or biometrics to overcome the limitation of unimodal biometric system for instance iris recognition system can be compromised by aging iris and electronic fingerprint recognition can be worsened by wornout or cut fingerprint while unimodal biometric system are limited by the integrity of their identifier it is unlikely that several unimodal system will suffer from identical limitation multimodal biometric system can obtain set of information from the same marker ie multiple image of an iris or scan of the same finger or information from different biometrics requiring fingerprint scan and using voice recognition a spoken passcodemultimodal biometric system can fuse these unimodal system sequentially simultaneously a combination thereof or in series which refer to sequential parallel hierarchical and serial integration mode respectively fusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stage of a recognition system in case of feature level fusion the data itself or the feature extracted from multiple biometrics are fused matchingscore level fusion consolidates the score generated by multiple classifier pertaining to different modality finally in case of decision level fusion the final result of multiple classifier are combined via technique such a majority voting feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other level of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier therefore fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition resultsspoof attack consist in submitting fake biometric trait to biometric system and are a major threat that can curtail their security multimodal biometric system are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attack but recent study have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait performance the discriminating power of all biometric technology depend on the amount of entropy they are able to encode and use in matching the following are used a performance metric for biometric system false match rate fmr also called far false accept rate the probability that the system incorrectly match the input pattern to a nonmatching template in the database it measure the percent of invalid input that are incorrectly accepted in case of similarity scale if the person is an imposter in reality but the matching score is higher than the threshold then he is treated a genuine this increase the fmr which thus also depends upon the threshold value false nonmatch rate fnmr also called frr false reject rate the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database it measure the percent of valid input that are incorrectly rejected receiver operating characteristic or relative operating characteristic roc the roc plot is a visual characterization of the tradeoff between the fmr and the fnmr in general the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input need to be for it to be considered a match if the threshold is reduced there will be fewer false nonmatches but more false accepts conversely a higher threshold will reduce the fmr but increase the fnmr a common variation is the detection error tradeoff det which is obtained using normal deviation scale on both ax this more linear graph illuminates the difference for higher performance rarer error equal error rate or crossover error rate eer or cer the rate at which both acceptance and rejection error are equal the value of the eer can be easily obtained from the roc curve the eer is a quick way to compare the accuracy of device with different roc curve in general the device with the lowest eer is the most accurate failure to enroll rate fte or fer the rate at which attempt to create a template from an input is unsuccessful this is most commonly caused by lowquality input failure to capture rate ftc within automatic system the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly template capacity the maximum number of set of data that can be stored in the system history an early cataloguing of fingerprint date back to when juan vucetich started a collection of fingerprint of criminal in argentina josh ellenbogen and nitzan lebovic argued that biometrics originated in the identification system of criminal activity developed by alphonse bertillon and by francis galton theory of fingerprint and physiognomy according to lebovic galton work led to the application of mathematical model to fingerprint phrenology and facial characteristic a part of absolute identification and a key to both inclusion and exclusion of population accordingly the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era and a form of soft control the theoretician david lyon showed that during the past two decade biometric system have penetrated the civilian market and blurred the line between governmental form of control and private corporate control kelly a gate identified a the turning point for the cultural language of our present in the language of cultural study the aftermath of wa a moment of articulation where object or event that have no necessary connection come together and a new discourse formation is established automated facial recognition a a homeland security technology adaptive biometric system adaptive biometric system aim to autoupdate the template or model to the intraclass variation of the operational data the twofold advantage of these system are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variation of the input data through adaptation recently adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community this research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantage first with an adaptive biometric system one no longer need to collect a large number of biometric sample during the enrollment process second it is no longer necessary to enroll again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment this convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system despite these advantage there are several open issue involved with these system for misclassification error false acceptance by the biometric system cause adaptation using impostor sample however continuous research effort are directed to resolve the open issue associated to the field of adaptive biometrics more information about adaptive biometric system can be found in the critical review by rattani et al recent advance in emerging biometrics in recent time biometrics based on brain electroencephalogram and heart electrocardiogram signal have emerged an example is finger vein recognition using patternrecognition technique based on image of human vascular pattern the advantage of this newer technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprint however such technology is generally more cumbersome and still ha issue such a lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time on the portability side of biometric product more and more vendor are embracing significantly miniaturized biometric authentication system ba thereby driving elaborate cost saving especially for largescale deployment operator signature an operator signature is a biometric mode where the manner in which a person using a device or complex system is recorded a a verification template one potential use for this type of biometric signature is to distinguish among remote user of telerobotic surgery system that utilize public network for communication proposed requirement for certain public network john michael mike mcconnell a former vice admiral in the united state navy a former director of u national intelligence and senior vice president of booz allen hamilton promoted the development of a future capability to require biometric authentication to access certain public network in his keynote speech at the biometric consortium conference a basic premise in the above proposal is that the person that ha uniquely authenticated themselves using biometrics with the computer is in fact also the agent performing potentially malicious action from that computer however if control of the computer ha been subverted for example in which the computer is part of a botnet controlled by a hacker then knowledge of the identity of the user at the terminal doe not materially improve network security or aid law enforcement activity animal biometrics rather than tag or tattoo biometric technique may be used to identify individual animal zebra stripe blood vessel pattern in rodent ear muzzle print bat wing pattern primate facial recognition and koala spot have all been tried issue and concern human dignity biometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authority to put it in foucauldian term of discipline and biopower by turning the human subject into a collection of biometric parameter biometrics would dehumanize the person infringe bodily integrity and ultimately offend human dignityin a wellknown case italian philosopher giorgio agamben refused to enter the united state in protest at the united state visitor and immigrant status indicator usvisit program requirement for visitor to be fingerprinted and photographed agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of biopolitical tattooing akin to the tattooing of jew during the holocaust according to agamben biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body agamben refers to the two word used by ancient greek for indicating life zoe which is the life common to animal and human just life and bios which is life in the human context with meaning and purpose agamben envisages the reduction to bare body for the whole humanity for him a new biopolitical relationship between citizen and the state is turning citizen into pure biological life zoe depriving them from their humanity bios and biometrics would herald this new world in dark matter on the surveillance of blackness surveillance scholar simone browne formulates a similar critique a agamben citing a recent study relating to biometrics rd that found that the gender classification system being researched is inclined to classify african a male and mongoloid a female consequently browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such system are subjectively designed and are vulnerable to cause error a described in the study above the stark expansion of biometric technology in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern the increasing commodification of biometrics by the private sector add to this danger of loss of human value indeed corporation value the biometric characteristic more than the individual value them browne go on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a biometric consciousness that entail informed public debate around these technology and their application and accountability by the state and the private sector where the ownership of and access to one own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from one body data must be understood a a rightother scholar have emphasized however that the globalized world is confronted with a huge mass of people with weak or absent civil identity most developing country have weak and unreliable document and the poorer people in these country do not have even those unreliable document without certified personal identity there is no certainty of right no civil liberty one can claim his right including the right to refuse to be identified only if he is an identifiable subject if he ha a public identity in such a sense biometrics could play a pivotal role in supporting and promoting respect for human dignity and fundamental right privacy and discrimination it is possible that data obtained during biometric enrollment may be used in way for which the enrolled individual ha not consented for example most biometric feature could disclose physiological andor pathological medical condition eg some fingerprint pattern are related to chromosomal disease iris pattern could reveal sex hand vein pattern could reveal vascular disease most behavioral biometrics could reveal neurological disease etc moreover second generation biometrics notably behavioral and electrophysiologic biometrics eg based on electrocardiography electroencephalography electromyography could be also used for emotion detectionthere are three category of privacy concern unintended functional scope the authentication go further than authentication such a finding a tumor unintended application scope the authentication process correctly identifies the subject when the subject did not wish to be identified covert identification the subject is identified without seeking identification or authentication ie a subject face is identified in a crowd danger to owner of secured item when thief can not get access to secure property there is a chance that the thief will stalk and assault the property owner to gain access if the item is secured with a biometric device the damage to the owner could be irreversible and potentially cost more than the secured property for example in malaysian car thief cut off a man finger when attempting to steal his mercedesbenz sclass attack at presentation in the context of biometric system presentation attack may also be called spoofing attack a per the recent isoiec standard presentation attack are defined a presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system these attack can be either impersonation or obfuscation attack impersonation attack try to gain access by pretending to be someone else obfuscation attack may for example try to evade face detection and face recognition system several method have been proposed to counteract presentation attack surveillance humanitarianism in time of crisis biometrics are employed by many aid program in time of crisis in order to prevent fraud and ensure that resource are properly available to those in need humanitarian effort are motivated by promoting the welfare of individual in need however the use of biometrics a a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interest of the group involved in the particular situation dispute over the use of biometrics between aid program and party official stall the distribution of resource to people that need help the most in july the united nation world food program and houthi rebel were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resource are provided to the hundred of thousand of civilian in yemen whose life are threatened the refusal to cooperate with the interest of the united nation world food program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the yemen population the use of biometrics may provide aid program with valuable information however it potential solution may not be best suited for chaotic time of crisis conflict that are caused by deeprooted political problem in which the implementation of biometrics may not provide a longterm solution cancelable biometrics one advantage of password over biometrics is that they can be reissued if a token or a password is lost or stolen it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version this is not naturally available in biometrics if someone face is compromised from a database they can not cancel or reissue it if the electronic biometric identifier is stolen it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature this render the person biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication such a the case with the hacking of securityclearancerelated background information from the office of personnel management opm in the united state cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement feature into biometrics to create a more secure system it wa first proposed by ratha et alcancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric feature in order to protect sensitive userspecific data if a cancelable feature is compromised the distortion characteristic are changed and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template which is used subsequently cancelable biometrics is one of the major category for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem in biometric cryptosystem the errorcorrecting coding technique are employed to handle intraclass variation this ensures a high level of security but ha limitation such a specific input format of only small intraclass variation several method for generating new exclusive biometrics have been proposed the first fingerprintbased cancelable biometric system wa designed and developed by tulyakov et al essentially cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or feature before matching the variability in the distortion parameter provides the cancelable nature of the scheme some of the proposed technique operate using their own recognition engine such a teoh et al and savvides et al whereas other method such a dabbah et al take the advantage of the advancement of the wellestablished biometric research for their recognition frontend to conduct recognition although this increase the restriction on the protection system it make the cancellable template more accessible for available biometric technology proposed soft biometrics soft biometrics are understood a not strict biometrical recognition practice that are proposed in favour of identity cheater and stealer trait are physical behavioral or adhered human characteristic that have been derived from the way human being normally distinguish their peer eg height gender hair color they are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifier although soft biometric characteristic lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably and can be easily faked they provide some evidence about the user identity that could be beneficial in other word despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject they are effective in distinguishing between people combination of personal attribute like gender race eye color height and other visible identification mark can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric system most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment two main ethical issue are raised by soft biometrics first some of soft biometric trait are strongly cultural based eg skin color for determining ethnicity risk to support racist approach biometric sex recognition at the best recognizes gender from tertiary sexual character being unable to determine genetic and chromosomal sex soft biometrics for aging recognition are often deeply influenced by ageist stereotype etc second soft biometrics have strong potential for categorizing and profiling people so risking of supporting process of stigmatization and exclusion data protection of biometric data in international law many country including the united state are planning to share biometric data with other nation in testimony before the u house appropriation committee subcommittee on homeland security on biometric identification in kathleen kraninger and robert a mocny commented on international cooperation and collaboration with respect to biometric data a follows to ensure we can shut down terrorist network before they ever get to the united state we must also take the lead in driving international biometric standard by developing compatible system we will be able to securely share terrorist information internationally to bolster our defense just a we are improving the way we collaborate within the u government to identify and weed out terrorist and other dangerous people we have the same obligation to work with our partner abroad to prevent terrorist from making any move undetected biometrics provide a new way to bring terrorist true identity to light stripping them of their greatest advantageremaining unknown according to an article written in by s magnuson in the national defense magazine entitled defense department under pressure to share biometric data the united state ha bilateral agreement with other nation aimed at sharing biometric data to quote that article miller a consultant to the office of homeland defense and america security affair said the united state ha bilateral agreement to share biometric data with about country every time a foreign leader ha visited washington during the last few year the state department ha made sure they sign such an agreement likelihood of full governmental disclosure certain member of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming in particular the unclassified report of the united state defense science board task force on defense biometrics state that it is wise to protect and sometimes even to disguise the true and total extent of national capability in area related directly to the conduct of securityrelated activity this also potentially applies to biometrics it go on to say that this is a classic feature of intelligence and military operation in short the goal is to preserve the security of source and method country applying biometrics country using biometrics include australia brazil bulgaria canada cyprus greece china gambia germany india iraq ireland israel italy malaysia

locationbased service problem related to user privacy arise location data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected a list of potentially sensitive professional and personal information that could be inferred about an individual knowing only their mobility trace wa published in by the electronic frontier foundation these include the movement of a competitor sale force attendance of a particular church or an individual presence in a motel or at an abortion clinic a recent mit study by de montjoye et al showed that four spatiotemporal point approximate place and time are enough to uniquely identify of million people in a mobility database the study further show that these constraint hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low therefore even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity medical people may not wish for their medical record to be revealed to others due to the confidentiality and sensitivity of what the information could reveal about their health for example they might be concerned that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment or it may be because they would not wish for others to know about any medical or psychological condition or treatment that would bring embarrassment upon themselves revealing medical data could also reveal other detail about one personal life there are three major category of medical privacy informational the degree of control over personal information physical the degree of physical inaccessibility to others and psychological the extent to which the doctor respect patient cultural belief inner thought value feeling and religious practice and allows them to make personal decision physician and psychiatrist in many culture and country have standard for doctorpatient relationship which include maintaining confidentiality in some case the physicianpatient privilege is legally protected these practice are in place to protect the dignity of patient and to ensure that patient feel free to reveal complete and accurate information required for them to receive the correct treatment to view the united state law on governing privacy of private health information see hipaa and the hitech act the australian law is the privacy act australia a well a statebased health record legislation political political privacy ha been a concern since voting system emerged in ancient time the secret ballot is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political view are not known to anyone other than the voter themselvesit is nearly universal in modern democracy and considered to be a basic right of citizenship in fact even where other right of privacy do not exist this type of privacy very often doe there are several form of voting fraud or privacy violation possible with the use of digital voting machine legality the legal protection of the right to privacy in general and of data privacy in particular varies greatly around the worldlaws and regulation related to privacy and data protection are constantly changing it is seen a important to keep abreast of any change in the law and to continually reassess compliance with data privacy and security regulation within academia institutional review board function to assure that adequate measure are taken to ensure both the privacy and confidentiality of human subject in researchprivacy concern exist wherever personally identifiable information or other sensitive information is collected stored used and finally destroyed or deleted in digital form or otherwise improper or nonexistent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issue informed consent mechanism including dynamic consent are important in communicating to data subject the different us of their personally

privacy united state safe harbor program and passenger name record issue the united state department of commerce created the international safe harbor privacy principle certification program in response to the directive on data protection directive of the european commission both the united state and the european union officially state that they are committed to upholding information privacy of individual but the former ha caused friction between the two by failing to meet the standard of the eu stricter law on personal data the negotiation of the safe harbor program wa in part to address this longrunning issue directive declares in chapter iv article that personal data may only be transferred from the country in the european economic area to country which provide adequate privacy protection historically establishing adequacy required the creation of national law broadly equivalent to those implemented by directive although there are exception to this blanket prohibition for example where the disclosure to a country outside the eea is made with the consent of the relevant individual article they are limited in practical scope a a result article created a legal risk to organization which transfer personal data from europe to the united state the program regulates the exchange of passenger name record information between the eu and the u according to the eu directive personal data may only be transferred to third country if that country provides an adequate level of protection some exception to this rule are provided for instance when the controller themself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rule the european commission ha set up the working party on the protection of individual with regard to the processing of personal data commonly known a the article working party the working party give advice about the level of protection in the european union and third countriesthe working party negotiated with u representative about the protection of personal data the safe harbor principle were the result notwithstanding that approval the selfassessment approach of the safe harbor remains controversial with a number of european privacy regulator and commentatorsthe safe harbor program address this issue in the following way rather than a blanket law imposed on all organization in the united state a voluntary program is enforced by the federal trade commission u organization which register with this program having selfassessed their compliance with a number of standard are deemed adequate for the purpose of article personal information can be sent to such organization from the eea without the sender being in breach of article or it eu national equivalent the safe harbor wa approved a providing adequate protection for personal data for the purpose of article by the european commission on july the safe harbor adoptee organization need to carefully consider their compliance with the onward transfer obligation where personal data originating in the eu is transferred to the u safe harbor and then onward to a third country the alternative compliance approach of binding corporate rule recommended by many eu privacy regulator resolve this issue in addition any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of hr data to the u safe harbor must be heard by a panel of eu privacy regulatorsin july a new controversial passenger name record agreement between the u and the eu wa made a short time afterwards the bush administration gave exemption for the department of homeland security for the arrival

policy concerning pnr the u had signed in february a memorandum of understanding mou with the czech republic in exchange of a visa waiver scheme without concerting before with brussels the tension

information technology security it security is the protection of computer system and network from attack by malicious actor that may result in unauthorized information disclosure theft of or damage to hardware software or data a well a from the disruption or misdirection of the service they providethe field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer system the internet and wireless network standard such a bluetooth and wifi also due to the growth of smart device including smartphones television and the various device that constitute the internet of thing iot cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenge of the contemporary world due to both the complexity of information system and the society they support security is of especially high importance for system that govern largescale system with farreaching physical effect such a power distribution election and finance vulnerability and attack a vulnerability is a weakness in design implementation operation or internal control of a computer or system most of the vulnerability that have been discovered are documented in the common vulnerability and exposure cve database an exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists vulnerability can be researched reverseengineered hunted or exploited using automated tool or customized scriptsvarious people or party are vulnerable to cyber attack however different group are likely to experience different type of attack more than othersin april the united kingdom department for science innovation technology realised a report on cyber attack over the last month they surveyed uk business uk registered charity and education institution the research found that of business and of charity overall recall any breach or attack from the last month this figure were much higher for medium business large business and highincome charity with or more in annual income yet although medium or large business are more often the victim since larger company have generally improved their security over the last decade small and midsize business smbs have also become increasing vulnerable a they often do not have advanced tool to defend the business smbs are most likely to be affected by malware ransomware phishing maninthemiddle attack and denialof service do attacksnormal people working for a business or simply using the internet are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyber attack these are where attacker indiscriminately target a many device service or user a possible they do this using technique that take advantage of the openness of the internet these strategy mostly include phishing ransomware water holing and scanningto secure a computer system it is important to understand the attack that can be made against it and these threat can typically be classified into one of the following category backdoor a backdoor in a computer system a cryptosystem or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security control these weakness may exist for many reason including original design or poor configuration due to the nature of backdoor they are of greater concern to company and database a opposed to individual backdoor may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reason however criminal often use malware to install backdoor giving them remote administrative access to a system once they have access cybercriminals can modify file steal personal information install unwanted software and even take control of the entire computerbackdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who ha access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer denialofservice attack denial of service attack do are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to it intended user attacker can deny service to individual victim such a by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive time to cause the victim account to be locked or they may overload the capability of a machine or network and block all user at once while a network attack from a single ip address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule many form of distributed denial of service ddos attack are possible where the attack come from a large number of point and defending is much more difficult such attack can originate from the zombie computer of a botnet or from a range of other possible technique including distributed reflective denial of service drdos where innocent system are fooled into sending traffic to the victim with such attack the amplification factor make the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves to understand why attacker may carry out these attack see the attacker motivation section directaccess attack a directaccess attack is when an unauthorized user an attacker gain physical access to a computer most likely to directly copy data from it or to steal information attacker may also compromise security by making operating system modification installing software worm keyloggers covert listening device or using wireless microphone even when the system is protected by standard security measure these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a cdrom or other bootable medium disk encryption and trusted platform module are designed to prevent these attack direct service attacker are related in concept to direct memory attack that allows an attacker to gain direct access to a computer memory the attack take advantage of a feature of modern computer that allow certain device such a external hard drive graphic card or network card to access the computer memory directlyto help prevent these attack computer user must ensure that they have a strong password that their computer is locked at all time when they are not using it and that they keep their computer with them at all time when traveling eavesdropping eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation communication usually between host on a network it typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague which when listened to by an attacker could be exploited data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various method unlike malware directaccess attack or other form of cyber attack eavesdropping attack are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of network or device making them difficult to notice in fact the attacker doe not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all he or she can insert the software onto a compromised device perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined timeusing a virtual private network vpn which encrypts data between two point is one of the most common form of protection against eavesdropping using the best form of encryption possible for wireless network is best practice a well a using http instead of unencrypted httpprograms such a carnivore and narusinsight have been used by the federal bureau of investigation fbi and nsa to eavesdrop on the system of internet service provider even machine that operate a a closed system ie with no contact with the outside world can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmission generated by the hardware tempest is a specification by the nsa referring to these attack malware malicious software malware is any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or it user once present on a computer it can leak sensitive detail such a personal information business information and password can give control of the system to the attacker and can corrupt or delete data permanently another type of malware is ransomware which is when malware installs itself onto a victim machine encrypts their file and then turn around and demand a ransom usually in bitcoin to return that data to the usertypes of malware include some of the following virus are a specific type of malware and are normally a malicious code that hijack software with the intension to do damage and spread copy of itself copy are made with the aim to spread to other program on a computer worm are similar to virus however virus can only function when a user run open a comprised program worm therefore are selfreplicating malware that spread between program apps and device without the need for human interaction trojan horse are program that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to trick user into installing them once installed a rat remote access trojan can create a secret backdoor on the affected device spyware is a type of malware that secretly gather information on an infected computer and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker one of the most common form of spyware are known a keyloggers which is a kind of malware which recorder all of a user keyboard inputskeystrokes used to allow hacker to harvest usernames password bank account and credit card number scareware a the name suggests is a form of malware which us social engineering manipulation to scare shock trigger anxiety or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate user into buying or installing unwanted software these attack often begin with a sudden popup with an urgent message usually warning the user that theyve broken the law or their device ha a virus multivector polymorphic attack surfacing in a new class of multivector polymorphic cyber threat combined several type of attack and changed form to avoid cybersecurity control a they spread multivector polymorphic attack a the name describes are both multivectored and polymorphic firstly they are a singular offensive that involves multiple method of attack in this sense they are multivectored ie the attack can use multiple mean of propagation such a via the web email and application however they are also multistaged meaning that they can infiltrate network and move laterally inside the network the attack can be polymorphic meaning that the cyberattacks used such a virus worm or trojan constantly change morph making it nearly impossible to detect them using signaturebased defence phishing phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such a usernames password and credit card detail directly from user by deceiving the user phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing instant messaging text message or on a phone call and it often directs user to enter detail at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one the fake website often asks for personal information such a login detail and password this information can then be used to gain access to the individual real account on the real website preying on a victim trust phishing can be classified a a form of social engineering attacker are using creative way to gain access to real account a common scam is for attacker to send fake electronic invoice to individual showing that they recently purchased music apps or others and instructing them to click on a link if the purchase were not authorized a more strategic type of phishing is spearphishing which leverage personal or organizationspecific detail to make the attacker appear like a trusted source spearphishing attack target specific individual rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempt privilege escalation privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to without authorization elevate their privilege or access level for example a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system the severity of attack can range from attack simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amount of data privilege escalation usually start with social engineering technique often phishingprivilege escalation can be separated into to strategy horizontal and vertical privilege escalation horizontal escalation or account takeover is where an attacker gain access to a normal user account that ha relatively lowlevel privilege this may be through stealing the user username and password once they have access they have gained a foothold and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of user at this same lower level gaining access to information of this similar privilege vertical escalation however target people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power such a an employee in it with a higher privilege using this privileged account will then enable to attacker to invade other account sidechannel attack any computational system affect it environment in some form this effect it ha on it environment includes a wide range of criterion which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on ram cell which a a consequence make a cold boot attack possible to hardware implementation fault that allow for access and or guessing of other value that normally should be inaccessible in sidechannel attack scenario the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess it internal state and a a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure social engineering social engineering in the context of computer security aim to convince a user to disclose secret such a password card number etc or grant physical access by for example impersonating a senior executive bank a contractor or a customer this generally involves exploiting people trust and relying on their cognitive bias a common scam involves email sent to accounting and finance department personnel impersonating their ceo and urgently requesting some action one of the main technique of social engineering are phishing attack in early the fbi reported that such business email compromise bec scam had cost u business more than billion in about two yearsin may the milwaukee buck nba team wa the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team president peter feigin resulting in the handover of all the team employee tax form spoofing spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data such a an ip address or username in order to gain access to information or resource that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain spoofing is closely related to phishing there are several type of spoofing including email spoofing is where an attacker forge the sending from or source address of an email ip address spoofing where an attacker alters the source ip address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system mac spoofing where an attacker modifies the medium access control mac address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity or to pose a another biometric spoofing where an attacker produce a fake biometric sample to pose a another user address resolution protocol arp spoofing where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their medium access control address with a different host ip address this cause data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended hostin the cybersecurity firm trellix published research on the lifethreatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry tampering tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data an intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system component of system it intended behavior or data socalled evil maid attack and security service planting of surveillance capability into router are example html smuggling html smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular html or web page html file can carry payload concealed a benign inert data in order to defeat content filter these payload can be reconstructed on the other side of the filterwhen a target user open the html the malicious code is activated the web browser then decodes the script which then unleashes the malware onto the target device information security culture employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organization cultural concept can help different segment of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization information security culture is the totality of pattern of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kindsandersson and reimers found that employee often do not see themselves a part of their organization information security effort and often take action that impede organizational change indeed the verizon data breach investigation report which examined security breach discovered of cybersecurity incident involved internal actor within a company research show information security culture need to be improved continuously in information security culture from analysis to change author commented it a neverending process a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance to manage the information security culture five step should be taken preevaluation strategic planning operative planning implementation and postevaluation preevaluation to identify the awareness of information security within employee and to analyze the current security policy strategic planning to come up with a better awareness program clear target need to be set assembling a team of skilled professional is helpful to achieve it operative planning a good security culture can be established based on internal communication management buyin security awareness and a training program implementation four stage should be used to implement the information security culture they arecommitment of the management communication with organizational member course for all organizational member commitment of the employeespostevaluation to ass the success of the planning and implementation and to identify unresolved area of concern computer protection countermeasure in computer security a countermeasure is an action device procedure or technique that reduces a threat a vulnerability or an attack by eliminating or preventing it by minimizing the harm it can cause or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be takensome common countermeasure are listed in the following section security by design security by design or alternately secure by design mean that the software ha been designed from the ground up to be secure in this case security is considered a main feature the uk government national cyber security centre separate secure cyber design principle into five section before a secure system is created or updated company should ensure they understand the fundamental and the context around the system they are trying to create and to identify any apart weakness in a system company should design and centre their security around technique and defence which make attacking their data or system inherently more challenging for attacker company should ensure that their core service that rely on technology are protected so that the technology is always available although system can be created which are safe against a multitude of attack that doe not mean that attack will not be attempted despite one security all company system should aim to be able to detect and spot attack a soon a they occur to ensure the most effective response to them company should create secure system designed so that any attack that is successful ha a loss severitythese design principle of security by design can include some of the following technique the principle of least privilege where each part of the system ha only the privilege that are needed for it function that way even if an attacker gain access to that part they only have limited access to the whole system automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystem code review and unit testing approach to make module more secure where formal correctness proof are not possible defense in depth where the design is such that more than one subsystem need to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it hold default secure setting and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure see failsafe for the equivalent in safety engineering ideally a secure system should require a deliberate conscious knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authority in order to make it insecure audit trail track system activity so that when a security breach occurs the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined storing audit trail remotely where they can only be appended to can keep intruder from covering their track full disclosure of all vulnerability to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept a short a possible when bug are discovered security architecture security architecture can be defined a the practice of designing computer system to achieve security goal these goal have overlap with the principle of security by design explored above including to make initial compromise of the system difficult and to limit the impact of any compromise in practice the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system and that new change are safe and meet the security requirement of the organisationsimilarly techopedia defines security architecture a a unified security design that address the necessity and potential risk involved in a certain scenario or environment it also specifies when and where to apply security control the design process is generally reproducible the key attribute of security architecture are the relationship of different component and how they depend on each other determination of control based on risk assessment good practice finance and legal matter the standardization of controlspracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business it and security concern in an organization security measure a state of computer security is the conceptual ideal attained by the use of the three process threat prevention detection and response these process are based on various policy and system component which include the following limiting the access of individual using user account access control and using cryptography can protect system file and data respectively firewall are by far the most common prevention system from a network security perspective a they can if properly configured shield access to internal network service and block certain kind of attack through packet filtering firewall can be both hardware and softwarebased firewall monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network intrusion detection system id product are designed to detect network attack inprogress and assist in postattack forensics while audit trail and log serve a similar function for individual system response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirement of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protection to notification of legal authority counterattack and the like in some special case the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored a it may happen that not all the compromised resource are detected cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threat and attack forward web proxy solution can prevent the client to visit malicious web page and inspect the content before downloading to the client machinestoday computer security consists mainly of preventive measure like firewall or an exit procedure a firewall can be defined a a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network such a the internet they can be implemented a software running on the machine hooking into the network stack or in the case of most unixbased operating system such a linux built into the operating system kernel to provide realtime filtering and blocking another implementation is a socalled physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic firewall are common amongst machine that are permanently connected to the internet some organization are turning to big data platform such a apache hadoop to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threatsin order to ensure adequate security the confidentiality integrity and availability of a network better known a the cia triad must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security to achieve those objective administrative physical and technical security measure should be employed the amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when it value is known vulnerability management vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying fixing or mitigating vulnerability especially in software and firmware vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security vulnerability can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerability such a open port insecure software configuration and susceptibility to malware in order for these tool to be effective they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release typically these update will scan for the new vulnerability that were introduced recently beyond vulnerability scanning many organization contract outside security auditor to run regular penetration test against their system to identify vulnerability in some sector this is a contractual requirement reducing vulnerability the act of assessing and reducing vulnerability to cyber attack is commonly referred to a information technology security assessment they aim to ass system for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerability while formal verification of the correctness of computer system is possible it is not yet common operating system formally verified include and sysgos pikeos but these make up a very small percentage of the market it is possible to reduce an attacker chance by keeping system up to date with security patch and update andor hiring people with expertise in security large company with significant threat can hire security operation centre soc analyst these are specialist in cyber defence with their role ranging from conducting threat analysis to investigating report of any new issue and preparing and testing disaster recovery planswhilst no measure can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack these measure can help mitigate the damage of possible attack the effect of data lossdamage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance outside of formal assessment there are various method of reducing vulnerability two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information it requires something you know a password or pin and something you have a card dongle cellphone or another piece of hardware this increase security a an unauthorized person need both of these to gain access protecting against social engineering and direct computer access physical attack can only be occur by noncomputer mean which can be difficult to enforce relative to the sensitivity of the information training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving people knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing people awareness of threat however even in highly disciplined environment eg military organization social engineering attack can still be difficult to foresee and prevent inoculation derived from inoculation theory seek to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent trick or trap by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempt through exposure to similar or related attempt hardware protection mechanism hardwarebased or assisted computer security also offer an alternative to softwareonly computer security using device and method such a dongle trusted platform module intrusionaware case drive lock disabling usb port and mobileenabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access or sophisticated backdoor access required in order to be compromised each of these is covered in more detail below usb dongle are typically used in software licensing scheme to unlock software capability but they can also be seen a a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device software the dongle or key essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key the principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle such a advanced encryption standard aes provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it another security application for dongle is to use them for accessing webbased content such a cloud software or virtual private network vpns in addition a usb dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer trusted platform module tpms secure device by integrating cryptographic capability onto access device through the use of microprocessor or socalled computersonachip tpms used in conjunction with serverside software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware device preventing unauthorized network and data access computer case intrusion detection refers to a device typically a pushbutton switch which detects when a computer case is opened the firmware or bios is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time drive lock are essentially software tool to encrypt hard drive making them inaccessible to thief tool exist specifically for encrypting external drive a well disabling usb port is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer infected usb dongle connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine network world a the most common hardware threat facing computer network disconnecting or disabling peripheral device like camera gps removable storage etc that are not in use mobileenabled access device are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phone builtin capability such a bluetooth the newer bluetooth low energy le nearfield communication nfc on nonios device and biometric validation such a thumbprint reader a well a qr code reader software designed for mobile device offer new secure way for mobile phone to connect to access control system these control system provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure building iommus allow for hardwarebased sandboxing of component in mobile and desktop computer by utilizing direct memory access protection physical unclonable function pufs can be used a a digital fingerprint or a unique identifier to integrated circuit and hardware providing user the ability to secure the hardware supply chain going into their system secure operating system one use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating system using secure operating system is a good way of ensuring computer security these are system that have achieved certification from an external securityauditing organization the most popular evaluation are common criterion cc secure coding in software engineering secure coding aim to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerability it is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure such system are secure by design beyond this formal verification aim to prove the correctness of the algorithm underlying a system important for cryptographic protocol for example capability and access control list within computer system two of the main security model capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control list acls and rolebased access control rbac an accesscontrol list acl with respect to a computer file system is a list of permission associated with an object an acl specifies which user or system process are granted access to object a well a what operation are allowed on given object rolebased access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized user used by the majority of enterprise with more than employee and can implement mandatory access control mac or discretionary access control dac a further approach capabilitybased security ha been mostly restricted to research operating system capability can however also be implemented at the language level leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard objectoriented design an opensource project in the area is the e language user security training the enduser is widely recognized a the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than of security incident and breach involve some kind of human error among the most commonly recorded form of error and misjudgment are poor password management sending email containing sensitive data and attachment to the wrong recipient the inability to recognize misleading url and to identify fake website and dangerous email attachment a common mistake that user make is saving their user idpassword in their browser to make it easier to log in to banking site this is a gift to attacker who have obtained access to a machine by some mean the risk may be mitigated by the use of twofactor authenticationas the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing security awareness training at all level not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandate but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individual and company from the great majority of cyber threat the focus on the enduser represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioner who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective and move along the line suggested by major security center to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization recognizing that a securityaware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attack digital hygiene related to enduser training digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and a the analogy with personal hygiene show is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measure to minimize the risk from cyber threat the assumption is that good cyber hygiene practice can give networked user another layer of protection reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attack or compromise another node or network especially from common cyberattacks cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence a military termthe most common act of digitalcyber hygiene can include updating malware protection cloud backup password and ensuring restricted admin right and network firewall a opposed to a purely technologybased defense against threat cyber hygiene mostly regard routine measure that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education it can be thought of a an abstract list of tip or measure that have been demonstrated a having a positive effect on personal andor collective digital security a such these measure can be performed by laypeople not just security expert cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene a computer virus relate to biological virus or pathogen however while the term computer virus wa coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer virus the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention perhaps a late a by internet pioneer vint cerf it ha since been adopted by the congress and senate of the united state the fbi eu institution and head of state difficulty of responding to breach responding to attempted security breach is often very difficult for a variety of reason including identifying attacker is difficult a they may operate through proxy temporary anonymous dialup account wireless connection and other anonymizing procedure which make backtracing difficult and are often located in another jurisdiction if they successfully breach security they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete log to cover their track the sheer number of attempted attack often by automated vulnerability scanner and computer worm is so large that organization can not spend time pursuing each law enforcement officer often lack the skill interest or budget to pursue attacker in addition the identification of attacker across a network may require log from various point in the network and in many country which may be difficult or timeconsuming to obtainwhere an attack succeeds and a breach occurs many jurisdiction now have in place mandatory security breach notification law type of security and privacy system at risk the growth in the number of computer system and the increasing reliance upon them by individual business industry and government mean that there are an increasing number of system at risk financial system the computer system of financial regulator and financial institution like the u security and exchange commission swift investment bank and commercial bank are prominent hacking target for cybercriminals interested in manipulating market and making illicit gain website and apps that accept or store credit card number brokerage account and bank account information are also prominent hacking target because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money making purchase or selling the information on the black market instore payment system and atm have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and pin the ucla internet report surveying the digital future found that the privacy of personal data created barrier to online sale and that more than nine out of internet user were somewhat or very concerned about credit card securitythe most common web technology for improving security between browser and website are named ssl secure socket layer and it successor tl transport layer security identity management and authentication service and domain name service allow company and consumer to engage in secure communication and commerce several version of ssl and tl are commonly used today in application such a web browsing email internet faxing instant messaging and voip voiceoverip there are various interoperable implementation of these technology including at least one implementation that is open source open source allows anyone to view the application source code and look for and report vulnerability the credit card company visa and mastercard cooperated to develop the secure emv chip which is embedded in credit card further development include the chip authentication program where bank give customer handheld card reader to perform online secure transaction other development in this arena include the development of technology such a instant issuance which ha enabled shopping mall kiosk acting on behalf of bank to issue onthespot credit card to interested customer utility and industrial equipment computer control function at many utility including coordination of telecommunication the power grid nuclear power plant and valve opening and closing in water and gas network the internet is a potential attack vector for such machine if connected but the stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computer not connected to the internet can be vulnerable in the computer emergency readiness team a division of the department of homeland security investigated hacking incident at energy company aviation the aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex system which could be attacked a simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussion worldwide much of the system relies on radio transmission which could be disrupted and controlling aircraft over ocean is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends to mile offshore there is also potential for attack from within an aircraftin europe with the paneuropean network service and newpens and in the u with the nextgen program air navigation service provider are moving to create their own dedicated network many modern passport are now biometric passport containing an embedded microchip that store a digitized photograph and personal information such a name gender and date of birth in addition more country are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identityrelated fraud the introduction of the epassport ha assisted border official in verifying the identity of the passport holder thus allowing for quick passenger processing plan are under way in the u the uk and australia to introduce smartgate kiosk with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology the airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper ticket towards the use of electronic ticket etickets these have been made possible by advance in online credit card transaction in partnership with the airline longdistance bus company are also switching over to eticketing transaction today the consequence of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity air traffic control outage loss of aircraft and even loss of life consumer device desktop computer and laptop are commonly targeted to gather password or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target smartphones tablet computer smart watch and other mobile device such a quantified self device like activity tracker have sensor such a camera microphone gps receiver compass and accelerometer which could be exploited and may collect personal information including sensitive health information wifi bluetooth and cell phone network on any of these device could be used a attack vector and sensor might be remotely activated after a successful breachthe increasing number of home automation device such a the nest thermostat are also potential target healthcare today many healthcare provider and health insurance company use the internet to provide enhanced product and service for example through use of telehealth to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare or fitness tracker to lower insurance premium the health care company humana partner with webmd oracle corporation ed and microsoft to enable it member to access their health care record a well a to provide an overview of health care plan patient record are increasingly being placed on secure inhouse network alleviating the need for extra storage space large corporation large corporation are common target in many case attack are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breach example include the loss of million of client credit card and financial detail by home depot staple target corporation and equifaxmedical record have been targeted in general identify theft health insurance fraud and impersonating patient to obtain prescription drug for recreational purpose or resale although cyber threat continue to increase of all organization did not increase security training for their business in all attack are financially motivated however security firm hbgary federal had a serious series of attack in from hacktivist group anonymous in retaliation for the firm ceo claiming to have infiltrated their group and sony picture wa hacked in with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leak and crippling the company by wiping workstation and server automobile vehicle are increasingly computerized with engine timing cruise control antilock brake seat belt tensioners door lock airbags and advanced driverassistance system on many model additionally connected car may use wifi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer device and the cell phone network selfdriving car are expected to be even more complex all of these system carry some security risk and such issue have gained wide attentionsimple example of risk include a malicious compact disc being used a an attack vector and the car onboard microphone being used for eavesdropping however if access is gained to a car internal controller area network the danger is much greater and in a widely publicized test hacker remotely carjacked a vehicle from mile away and drove it into a ditchmanufacturers are reacting in numerous way with tesla in pushing out some security fix over the air into it car computer system in the area of autonomous vehicle in september the united state department of transportation announced some initial safety standard and called for state to come up with uniform policiesadditionally edrivers license are being developed using the same technology for example mexico licensing authority icv ha used a smart card platform to issue the first edrivers license to the city of monterrey in the state of nuevo len shipping shipping company have adopted rfid radio frequency identification technology a an efficient digitally secure tracking device unlike a barcode rfid can be read up to foot away rfid is used by fedex and ups government government and military computer system are commonly attacked by activist and foreign power local and regional government infrastructure such a traffic light control police and intelligence agency communication personnel record a well a student recordsthe fbi cia and pentagon all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their building however the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world more and more company are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology ge acuvision for example offer a single panel platform for access control alarm monitoring and digital recording internet of thing and physical vulnerability the internet of thing iot is the network of physical object such a device vehicle and building that are embedded with electronics software sensor and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data concern have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenge involvedwhile the iot creates opportunity for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased system it also provides opportunity for misuse in particular a the internet of thing spread widely cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat if a front door lock is connected to the internet and can be lockedunlocked from a phone then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone people could stand to lose much more than their credit card number in a world controlled by iotenabled device thief have also used electronic mean to circumvent noninternetconnected hotel door locksan attack that target physical infrastructure andor human life is sometimes referred to a a cyberkinetic attack a iot device and appliance gain currency cyberkinetic attack can become pervasive and significantly damaging medical system medical device have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerability demonstrated including both inhospital diagnostic equipment and implanted device including pacemaker and insulin pump there are many report of hospital and hospital organization getting hacked including ransomware attack window xp exploit virus and data breach of sensitive data stored on hospital server on december the u food and drug administration released it recommendation for how medical device manufacturer should maintain the security of internetconnected device but no structure for enforcement energy sector in distributed generation system the risk of a cyber attack is real according to daily energy insider an attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time and such an attack could have just a severe consequence a a natural disaster the district of columbia is considering creating a distributed energy resource der authority within the city with the goal being for customer to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility pepco the chance to better estimate energy demand the dc proposal however would allow thirdparty vendor to create numerous point of energy distribution which could potentially create more opportunity for cyber attacker to threaten the electric grid telecommunication perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the sim subscriber identity module card a device that is embedded in most of the world cellular device before any service can be obtained the sim card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment the smart card web server draft standard scws defines the interface to an http server in a smart card test are being conducted to secure ota overtheair payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone combination simdvd device are being developed through smart video card technology which embeds a dvdcompliant optical disc into the card body of a regular sim card other telecommunication development involving digital security include mobile signature which use the embedded sim card to generate a legally binding electronic signature cost and impact of security breach serious financial damage ha been caused by security breach but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident the only data available is that which is made public by the organization involved several computer security consulting firm produce estimate of total worldwide loss attributable to virus and worm attack and to hostile digital act in general the loss estimate by these firm range from billion worm and virus only to billion for all form of covert attack the reliability of these estimate is often challenged the underlying methodology is basically anecdotalhowever reasonable estimate of the financial cost of security breach can actually help organization make rational investment decision according to the classic gordonloeb model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss ie the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyberinformation security breach attacker motivation a with physical security the motivation for breach of computer security vary between attacker some are thrillseekers or vandal some are activist others are criminal looking for financial gain statesponsored attacker are now common and well resourced but started with amateur such a markus hess who hacked for the kgb a recounted by clifford stoll in the cuckoo egg attacker motivation can vary for all type of attack from pleasure to for political goal for example hacktivists may target a company a company or organisation that carry out activity they do not agree with this would be to create bad publicity for the company by having it website crash high capability hacker often with larger backing or state sponsorship may attack based on the demand of their financial backer these attack are more likely to attempt more serious attack an example of a more serious attack wa the ukraine power grid hack which reportedly utilised the spearphising destruction of file and denialofservice attack to carry out the full attackadditionally recent attacker motivation can be traced back to extremist organization seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agenda the growth of the internet mobile technology and inexpensive computing device have led to a rise in capability but also to the risk to environment that are deemed a vital to operation all critical targeted environment are susceptible to compromise and this ha led to a series of proactive study on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivation by these type of actor several stark difference exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actor seeking to attack based on an ideological preferencea standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system and who might be motivated to breach it the level and detail of precaution will vary depending on the system to be secured a home personal computer bank and classified military network face very different threat even when the underlying technology in use are similar computer security incident management computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack an incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such a a data breach or system failure the intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident limit damage and assist recovery to business a usual responding to compromise quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerability restore service and process and minimize loss incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practice to stop an intrusion before it cause damage typical incident response plan contain a set of written instruction that outline the organization response to a cyberattack without a documented plan in place an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholder may not understand their role process and procedure during an escalation slowing the organization response and resolution there are four key component of a computer security incident response plan preparation preparing stakeholder on the procedure for handling computer security incident or compromise detection and analysis identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident containment eradication and recovery isolating affected system to prevent escalation and limit impact pinpointing the genesis of the incident removing malware affected system and bad actor from the environment and restoring system and data when a threat no longer remains post incident activity post mortem analysis of the incident it root cause and the organization response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response effort notable attack and breach some illustrative example of different type of computer security breach are given below robert morris and the first computer worm in computer were connected to the internet and most were mainframe minicomputer and professional workstation on november many started to slow down because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computer the first internet computer worm the software wa traced back to cornell university graduate student robert tappan morris who said he wanted to count how many machine were connected to the internet rome laboratory in over a hundred intrusion were made by unidentified cracker into the rome laboratory the u air force main command and research facility using trojan horse hacker were able to obtain unrestricted access to rome networking system and remove trace of their activity the intruder were able to obtain classified file such a air tasking order system data and furthermore able to penetrate connected network of national aeronautics and space administration goddard space flight center wrightpatterson air force base some defense contractor and other private sector organization by posing a a trusted rome center user tjx customer credit card detail in early american apparel and home good company tjx announced that it wa the victim of an unauthorized computer system intrusion and that the hacker had accessed a system that stored data on credit card debit card check and merchandise return transaction stuxnet attack in the computer worm known a stuxnet reportedly ruined almost onefifth of iran nuclear centrifuge it did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controller plcs in a targeted attack this is generally believed to have been launched by israel and the united state to disrupt iran nuclear program although neither ha publicly admitted this global surveillance disclosure in early document provided by edward snowden were published by the washington post and the guardian exposing the massive scale of nsa global surveillance there were also indication that the nsa may have inserted a backdoor in a nist standard for encryption this standard wa later withdrawn due to widespread criticism the nsa additionally were revealed to have tapped the link between google data center target and home depot breach a ukrainian hacker known a rescator broke into target corporation computer in stealing roughly million credit card and then home depot computer in stealing between and million credit card number warning were delivered at both corporation but ignored physical security breach using self checkout machine are believed to have played a large role the malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting say jim walter director of threat intelligence operation at security technology company mcafee meaning that the heist could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrator responded to the warning the size of the theft ha resulted in major attention from state and federal united state authority and the investigation is ongoing office of personnel management data breach in april the office of personnel management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach resulting in the theft of approximately million personnel record handled by the office the office of personnel management hack ha been described by federal official a among the largest breach of government data in the history of the united state data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such a social security number name date and place of birth address and fingerprint of current and former government employee a well a anyone who had undergone a government background check it is believed the hack wa perpetrated by chinese hacker ashley madison breach in july a hacker group is known a the impact team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website ashley madison created by avid life medium the group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data a well after the breach the impact team dumped email from the company ceo to prove their point and threatened to dump customer data unless the website wa taken down permanently when avid life medium did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed file one and the second after the second data dump avid life medium ceo noel biderman resigned but the website remained to function colonial pipeline ransomware attack in june the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the u and led to shortage across the east coast legal issue and global regulation international legal issue of cyber attack are complicated in nature there is no global base of common rule to judge and eventually punish cybercrime and cybercriminals and where security firm or agency do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack often the local authority can not take action due to lack of law under which to prosecute proving attribution for cybercrime and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agency computer virus switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world using the fact that we dont have the capability to globally police operation like this so the internet is a if someone had given free plane ticket to all the online criminal of the world the use of technique such a dynamic dns fast flux and bullet proof server add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement role of government the role of the government is to make regulation to force company and organization to protect their system infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks but also to protect it own national infrastructure such a the national powergridthe government regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated for some cyberspace wa seen a a virtual space that wa to remain free of government intervention a can be seen in many of today libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussionsmany government official and expert think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem r clarke said during a panel discussion at the rsa security conference in san francisco he belief that the industry only responds when you threaten regulation if the industry doesnt respond to the threat you have to follow through on the other hand executive from the private sector agree that improvement are necessary but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently daniel r mccarthy analyzed this publicprivate partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political orderon may the un security council held it second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenge to international peace according to un secretarygeneral

it also requires that certain organization appoint a data protection officer dpo national action computer emergency response team most country have their own computer emergency response team to protect network security canada since canada ha had a cybersecurity strategy this function a a counterpart document to the national strategy and action plan for critical infrastructure the strategy ha three main pillar securing government system securing vital private cyber system and helping canadian to be secure online there is also a cyber incident management framework to provide a coordinated response in the event of a cyber incidentthe canadian cyber incident response centre ccirc is responsible for mitigating and responding to threat to canada critical infrastructure and cyber system it provides support to mitigate cyber threat technical support to respond recover from targeted cyber attack and provides online tool for member of canada critical infrastructure sector it post regular cybersecurity bulletin operates an online reporting tool where individual and organization can report a cyber incidentto inform the general public on how to protect themselves online public safety canada ha partnered with stopthinkconnect a coalition of nonprofit private sector and government organization and launched the cyber security cooperation program they also run the getcybersafe portal for canadian citizen and cyber security awareness month during octoberpublic safety canada aim to begin an evaluation of canada cybersecurity strategy in early australia australian federal government announced an million investment to fortify the cybersecurity resilience of small and medium enterprise smes and enhance their capability in responding to cyber threat this financial backing is an integral component of the soontobeunveiled australian cyber security strategy slated for release within the current week a substantial allocation of million is earmarked for the establishment of a voluntary cyber health check program facilitating business in conducting a comprehensive and tailored selfassessment of their cybersecurity upskill this avantgarde health assessment serf a a diagnostic tool enabling enterprise to ascertain the robustness of australia cyber security regulation furthermore it affords them access to a repository of educational resource and material fostering the acquisition of skill necessary for an elevated cybersecurity posture this groundbreaking initiative wa jointly disclosed by minister for cyber security clare oneil and minister for small business julie collins america the united state ha it first fully formed cyber plan in year a a result of the release of this national cyber plan in this policy the u say it will protect the country by keeping network system function and data safe promote american wealth by building a strong digital economy and encouraging strong domestic innovation peace and safety should be kept by making it easier for the u to stop people from using computer tool for bad thing working with friend and partner to do this and increase the united state impact around the world to support the main idea behind an open safe reliable and compatible internet the new u cyber strategy seek to allay some of those concern by promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace urging nation to adhere to a set of norm both through international law and voluntary standard it also call for specific measure to harden u government network from attack like the june intrusion into the u office of personnel management opm which compromised the record of about million current and former government employee and the strategy call for the u to continue to name and shame bad cyber actor calling them out publicly for attack when possible along with the use of economic sanction and diplomatic pressure india some provision for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rule framed under the information technology act national cyber security policy is a policy framework by the ministry of electronics and information technology meity which aim to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyberattacks and safeguard information such a personal information of web user financial and banking information and sovereign data cert in is the nodal agency which monitor the cyber threat in the country the post of national cyber security coordinator ha also been created in the prime minister office pmo the indian company act ha also introduced cyber law and cybersecurity obligation on the part of indian director some provision for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rule framed under the information technology act update in south korea following cyberattacks in the first half of when the government news medium television station and bank website were compromised the national government committed to the training of new cybersecurity expert by the south korean government blamed it northern counterpart for these attack a well a incident that occurred in and but pyongyang denies the accusation united state legislation the usc the computer fraud and abuse act is the key legislation it prohibits unauthorized access or damage of protected computer a defined in usc although various other measure have been proposed none ha succeeded in executive order improving critical infrastructure

christian science monitor wrote in a article titled the new cyber arm race in the future war will not just be fought by soldier with gun or with plane that drop bomb they will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer program that disrupt or destroy critical industry like utility transportation communication and energy such attack could also disable military network that control the movement of troop the path of jet fighter the command and control of warship this ha led to new term such a cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism the united state cyber command wa created in and many other country have similar force there are a few critical voice that question whether cybersecurity is a significant a threat a it is made out to be career cybersecurity is a fastgrowing field of it concerned with reducing organization risk of hack or data breach according to research from the enterprise strategy group of organization say that they have a problematic shortage of cybersecurity skill in up from in commercial government and nongovernmental organization all employ cybersecurity professional the fastest increase in demand for

operational technology the otccf wa endorsed by the infocomm medium development authority imda it outline the different ot cybersecurity job position a well a the technical skill and core competency necessary it also depicts the many career path available including vertical and lateral advancement opportunity terminology the following term used with regard to computer security are explained below access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of user through the use of authentication system these system can protect either the whole computer such a through an interactive login screen or individual service such a a ftp server there are many method for identifying and authenticating user such a password identification card smart card and biometric system antivirus software consists of computer program that attempt to identify thwart and eliminate computer virus and other malicious software malware application are executable code so general corporate practice is to restrict or block user the power to install them to install them only when there is a demonstrated need eg software needed to perform assignment to install only those which are known to be reputable preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application and to reduce the attack surface by installing a few a possible they are typically run with least privilege with a robust process in place to identify test and install any released security patch or update for them for example program can be installed into an individual user account which limit the program potential access a well a being a mean control which user have specific exception to policy in linux freebsd openbsd and other unixlike operating system there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other mean of restricting the application to it own sandbox for example linux provides namespaces and cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resource generalized security framework such a selinux or apparmor help administrator control access java and other language which compile to java byte code and run in the java virtual machine can have their access to other application controlled at the virtual machine level some software can be run in software container which can even provide their own set of system library limiting the software or anyone controlling it access to the server version of the library authentication technique can be used to ensure that communication endpoint are who they say they are automated theorem proving and other verification tool can be used to enable critical algorithm and code used in secure system to be mathematically proven to meet their specification backup are one or more copy kept of important computer file typically multiple copy will be kept at different location so that if a copy is stolen or damaged other copy will still exist capability and access control list technique can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control capability v acls discus their use chain of trust technique can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded ha been certified a authentic by the system designer confidentiality is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person cryptographic technique can be used to defend data in transit between system reducing the probability that the data exchange between system can be intercepted or modified cyberwarfare is an internetbased conflict that involves politically motivated attack on information and information system such attack can for example disable official website and network disrupt or disable essential service steal or alter classified data and cripple financial system data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two update of a data recordencryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message cryptographically secure cipher are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible symmetrickey cipher are suitable for bulk encryption using shared key and publickey encryption using digital certificate can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance endpoint security software aid network in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry point made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected device such a laptop mobile device and usb drive firewall serve a a gatekeeper system between network allowing only traffic that match defined rule they often include detailed logging and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention feature they are nearuniversal between company local area network and the internet but can also be used internally to impose traffic rule between network if network segmentation is configured a hacker is someone who seek to breach defense and exploit weakness in a computer system or network honey pot are computer that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by cracker they can be used to catch cracker and to identify their technique intrusiondetection system are device or software application that monitor network or system for malicious activity or policy violation a microkernel is an approach to operating system design which ha only the nearminimum amount of code running at the most privileged level and run other element of the operating system such a device driver protocol stack and file system in the safer le privileged user space pinging the standard ping application can be used to test if an ip address is in use if it is attacker may then try a port scan to detect which service are exposed a port scan is used to probe an ip address for open port to identify accessible network service and application a key logger is spyware that silently capture and store each keystroke that a user type on the computer keyboard social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individual to breach security logic bomb is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lie dormant until it is triggered by a specific event zero trust security mean that no one is trusted by default from inside or outside the network and verification is required from everyone trying to gain access to resource on the network history since the internet arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent year the notion of cybersecurity ha become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal life cybersecurity and cyber threat have been consistently present for the last year of technological change in the and computer security wa mainly limited to academia until the conception of the internet where with increased connectivity computer virus and network intrusion began to take off after the spread of virus in the the marked the institutionalization of organized attack such a distributed denial of service this led to the formalization of cybersecurity a a professional disciplinethe april session organized by willis ware at the spring joint computer conference and the later publication of the ware report were foundational moment in the history of the field of computer security ware work straddled the intersection of material cultural political and social concernsa nist publication introduced the cia triad of confidentiality integrity and availability a a clear and simple way to describe key security goal while still relevant many more elaborate framework have since been proposedhowever in the and there were no grave computer threat because computer and the internet were still developing and security threat were easily identifiable more often threat came from malicious insider who gained unauthorized access to sensitive document and file although malware and network breach existed during the early year they did not use them for financial gain by the second half of the established computer firm like ibm started offering commercial access control system and computer security software productsone of the earliest example of an attack on a computer network wa the computer worm creeper written by bob thomas at bbn which propagated through the arpanet in the program wa purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload a later program reaper wa created by ray tomlinson in and used to destroy creeperbetween september and june a group of german hacker performed the first documented case of cyber espionage the group hacked into american defense contractor university and military base network and sold gathered information to the soviet kgb the group wa led by markus hess who wa arrested on june he wa convicted of espionage along with two coconspirator on feb in one of the first computer worm called the morris worm wa distributed via the internet it gained significant mainstream medium attentionin netscape started developing the protocol ssl shortly after the national center for supercomputing application ncsa launched mosaic the first web browser in netscape had ssl version ready in but it wa never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerability these weakness included replay attack and a vulnerability that allowed hacker to alter unencrypted communication sent by user however in february netscape launched version national security agency nsa is responsible for the protection of u information system and also for collecting foreign intelligence the agency analyzes commonly used software and system configuration to find security flaw which it can use for offensive purpose against competitor of the united statesnsa contractor created and sold clickandshoot attack tool to u agency and close ally but eventually the tool made their way to foreign adversary in nsa own hacking tool were hacked and they have been used by russia and north korea nsa employee and contractor have been recruited at high salary by adversary anxious to compete in cyberwarfare in the united state and israel began exploiting security flaw in the microsoft window operating system to attack and damage equipment used in iran to refine nuclear material iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability which it began using against the united state notable scholar see also reference

detect and prevent system idp studi by gartner magic quadrant for network intrus prevent system applianc,an intrusion detection system id also intrusion prevention system or ip is a device or software application that monitor a network or system for malicious activity or policy violation any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management siem system a siem system combine output from multiple source and us alarm filtering technique to distinguish malicious activity from false alarmsids type range in scope from single computer to large network the most common classification are network intrusion detection system nids and hostbased intrusion detection system hids a system that monitor important operating system file is an example of an hids while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an nids it is also possible to classify id by detection approach the most wellknown variant are signaturebased detection recognizing bad pattern such a malware and anomalybased detection detecting deviation from a model of good traffic which often relies on machine learning another common variant is reputationbased detection recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation score some id product have the ability to respond to detected intrusion system with response capability are typically referred to a an intrusion prevention system intrusion detection system can also serve specific purpose by augmenting them with custom tool such a using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic comparison with firewall although they both relate to network security an id differs from a firewall in that a traditional network firewall distinct from a nextgeneration firewall us a static set of rule to permit or deny network connection it implicitly prevents intrusion assuming an appropriate set of rule have been defined essentially firewall limit access between network to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network an id describes a suspected intrusion once it ha taken place and signal an alarm an id also watch for attack that originate from within a system this is traditionally achieved by examining network communication identifying heuristic and pattern often known a signature of common computer attack and taking action to alert operator a system that terminates connection is called an intrusion prevention system and performs access control like an application layer firewall intrusion detection category id can be classified by where detection take place network or host or the detection method that is employed signature or anomalybased analyzed activity network intrusion detection system network intrusion detection system nids are placed at a strategic point or point within the network to monitor traffic to and from all device on the network it performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire subnet and match the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attack once an attack is identified or abnormal behavior is sensed the alert can be sent to the administrator an example of an nids would be installing it on the subnet where firewall are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network opnet and netsim are commonly used tool for simulating network intrusion detection system nid system are also capable of comparing signature for similar packet to link and drop harmful detected packet which have a signature matching the record in the nids when we classify the design of the nids according to the system interactivity property there are two type online and offline nids often referred to a inline and tap mode respectively online nids deal with the network in real time it analysis the ethernet packet and applies some rule to decide if it is an attack or not offline nids deal with stored data and pass it through some process to decide if it is an attack or not nids can be also combined with other technology to increase detection and prediction rate artificial neural network based id are capable of analyzing huge volume of data in a smart way due to the selforganizing structure that allows in id to more efficiently recognize intrusion pattern neural network assist id in predicting attack by learning from mistake inn id help develop an early warning system based on two layer the first layer accepts single value while the second layer take the first layer output a input the cycle repeat and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen pattern in the network this system can average detection and classification rate based on research result of network attack divided in four category do probe remotetolocal and usertoroot host intrusion detection system host intrusion detection system hids run on individual host or device on the network a hids monitor the inbound and outbound packet from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected it take a snapshot of existing system file and match it to the previous snapshot if the critical system file were modified or deleted an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate an example of hids usage can be seen on mission critical machine which are not expected to change their configuration detection method signaturebased signaturebased id is the detection of attack by looking for specific pattern such a byte sequence in network traffic or known malicious instruction sequence used by malware this terminology originates from antivirus software which refers to these detected pattern a signature although signaturebased id can easily detect known attack it is difficult to detect new attack for which no pattern is available in signaturebased id the signature are released by a vendor for all it product ontime updating of the id with the signature is a key aspect anomalybased anomalybased intrusion detection system were primarily introduced to detect unknown attack in part due to the rapid development of malware the basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity and then compare new behavior against this model since these model can be trained according to the application and hardware configuration machine learning based method ha a better generalized property in comparison to traditional signaturebased id although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attack it may suffer from false positive previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified a malicious most of the existing id suffer from the timeconsuming during detection process that degrades the performance of id efficient feature selection algorithm make the classification process used in detection more reliablenew type of what could be called anomalybased intrusion detection system are being viewed by gartner a user and entity behavior analytics ueba an evolution of the user behavior analytics category and network traffic analysis nta in particular nta deal with malicious insider a well a targeted external attack that have compromised a user machine or account gartner ha noted that some organization have opted for nta over more traditional id intrusion prevention some system may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system intrusion detection and prevention system idp are primarily focused on identifying possible incident logging information about them and reporting attempt in addition organization use idp for other purpose such a identifying problem with security policy documenting existing threat and deterring individual from violating security policy idp have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organizationidps typically record information related to observed event notify security administrator of important observed event and produce report many idp can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding they use several response technique which involve the idp stopping the attack itself changing the security environment eg reconfiguring a firewall or changing the attack contentintrusion prevention system ip also known a intrusion detection and prevention system idp are network security appliance that monitor network or system activity for malicious activity the main function of intrusion prevention system are to identify malicious activity log information about this activity report it and attempt to block or stop it intrusion prevention system are considered extension of intrusion detection system because they both monitor network traffic andor system activity for malicious activity the main difference are unlike intrusion detection system intrusion prevention system are placed inline and are able to actively prevent or block intrusion that are detected ip can take such action a sending an alarm dropping detected malicious packet resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending ip address an ip also can correct cyclic redundancy check crc error defragment packet stream mitigate tcp sequencing issue and clean up unwanted transport and network layer option classification intrusion prevention system can be classified into four different type networkbased intrusion prevention system nip monitor the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity wireless intrusion prevention system wips monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocol network behavior analysis nba examines network traffic to identify threat that generate unusual traffic flow such a distributed denial of service ddos attack certain form of malware and policy violation hostbased intrusion prevention system hip an installed software package which monitor a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing event occurring within that host detection method the majority of intrusion prevention system utilize one of three detection method signaturebased statistical anomalybased and stateful protocol analysis signaturebased detection signaturebased id monitor packet in the network and compare with preconfigured and predetermined attack pattern known a signature statistical anomalybased detection an id which is anomalybased will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline the baseline will identify what is normal for that network what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocol are used it may however raise a false positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baseline are not intelligently configured ensemble model that use matthew correlation coefficient to identify unauthorized network traffic have obtained accuracy stateful protocol analysis detection this method identifies deviation of protocol state by comparing observed event with predetermined profile of generally accepted definition of benign activity placement the correct placement of intrusion detection system is critical and varies depending on the network the most common placement is behind the firewall on the edge of a network this practice provides the id with high visibility of traffic entering your network and will not receive any traffic between user on the network the edge of the network is the point in which a network connects to the extranet another practice that can be accomplished if more resource are available is a strategy where a technician will place their first id at the point of highest visibility and depending on resource availability will place another at the next highest point continuing that process until all point of the network are coveredif an id is placed beyond a network firewall it main purpose would be to defend against noise from the internet but more importantly defend against common attack such a port scan and network mapper an id in this position would monitor layer through of the osi model and would be signaturebased this is a very useful practice because rather than showing actual breach into the network that made it through the firewall attempted breach will be shown which reduces the amount of false positive the id in this position also assist in decreasing the amount of time it take to discover successful attack against a networksometimes an id with more advanced feature will be integrated with a firewall in order to be able to intercept sophisticated attack entering the network example of advanced feature would include multiple security context in the routing level and bridging mode all of this in turn potentially reduces cost and operational complexityanother option for id placement is within the actual network these will reveal attack or suspicious activity within the network ignoring the security within a network can cause many problem it will either allow user to bring about security risk or allow an attacker who ha already broken into the network to roam around freely intense intranet security make it difficult for even those hacker within the network to maneuver around and escalate their privilege limitation noise can severely limit an intrusion detection system effectiveness bad packet generated from software bug corrupt dns data and local packet that escaped can create a significantly high falsealarm rate it is not uncommon for the number of real attack to be far below the number of falsealarms number of real attack is often so far below the number of falsealarms that the real attack are often missed and ignored many attack are geared for specific version of software that are usually outdated a constantly changing library of signature is needed to mitigate threat outdated signature database can leave the id vulnerable to newer strategy for signaturebased id there will be lag between a new threat discovery and it signature being applied to the id during this lag time the id will be unable to identify the threat it can not compensate for weak identification and authentication mechanism or for weakness in network protocol when an attacker gain access due to weak authentication mechanism then id can not prevent the adversary from any malpractice encrypted packet are not processed by most intrusion detection device therefore the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusion have occurred intrusion detection software provides information based on the network address that is associated with the ip packet that is sent into the network this is beneficial if the network address contained in the ip packet is accurate however the address that is contained in the ip packet could be faked or scrambled due to the nature of nids system and the need for them to analyse protocol a they are captured nids system can be susceptible to the same protocolbased attack to which network host may be vulnerable invalid data and tcpip stack attack may cause a nids to crash the security measure on cloud computing do not consider the variation of user privacy need they provide the same security mechanism for all user no matter if user are company or an individual person evasion technique there are a number of technique which attacker are using the following are considered simple measure which can be taken to evade id fragmentation by sending fragmented packet the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the detection system ability to detect the attack signature avoiding default the tcp port utilised by a protocol doe not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported for example an id may expect to detect a trojan on port if an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port the id may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan coordinated lowbandwidth attack coordinating a scan among numerous attacker or agent and allocating different port or host to different attacker make it difficult for the id to correlate the captured packet and deduce that a network scan is in progress address spoofingproxying attacker can increase the difficulty of the security administrator ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy server to bounce an attack if the source is spoofed and bounced by a server it make it very difficult for id to detect the origin of the attack pattern change evasion id generally rely on pattern matching to detect an attack by changing the data used in the attack slightly it may be possible to evade detection for example an internet message access protocol imap server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow and an id is able to detect the attack signature of common attack tool by modifying the payload sent by the tool so that it doe not resemble the data that the id expects it may be possible to evade detection development the earliest preliminary id concept wa delineated in by james anderson at the national security agency and consisted of a set of tool intended to help administrator review

information about themselves and thereby express themselves selectively the domain of privacy partially overlap with security which can include the concept of appropriate use and protection of information privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity there have been many different conception of privacy throughout history most culture recognize the right of an individual to withhold aspect of their personal life from public record the right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government corporation or individual is part of many country privacy law and in some case constitution with the rise of technology the debate regarding privacy ha expanded from a bodily sense to include a digital sense in most country the right to digital privacy is considered an extension of the original right to privacy and many country have passed act that further protect digital privacy from public and private entity there are multiple technique to invade privacy which may be employed by corporation or government for profit or political reason conversely in order to protect privacy people may employ encryption or anonymity measure etymology the word privacy is derived from the latin word privatus which mean set apart from what is public personal and belonging to oneself and not to the state history privacy ha historical root in ancient greek philosophical discussion the most wellknown of these wa aristotle distinction between two sphere of life the public sphere of the polis associated with political life and the private sphere of the oikos associated with domestic life privacy is valued along with other basic necessity of life in the jewish deuterocanonical book of sirachin the united state more systematic treatise of privacy did not appear until the with the development of privacy law in america technology a technology ha advanced the way in which privacy is protected and violated ha changed with it in the case of some technology such a the printing press or the internet the increased ability to share information can lead to new way in which privacy can be breached it is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the united state wa the article by samuel warren and louis brandeis the right to privacy and that it wa written mainly in response to the increase in newspaper and photograph made possible by printing technologiesin written by george orwell wa published a classic dystopian novel describes the life of winston smith in located in oceania a totalitarian state the allcontrolling party the party in power led by big brother is able to control power through mass surveillance and limited freedom of speech and thought george orwell provides commentary on the negative effect of totalitarianism particularly on privacy and censorship parallel have been drawn between and modern censorship and privacy a notable example being that large social medium company rather than the government are able to monitor a user data and decide what is allowed to be said online through their censorship policy ultimately for monetary purposesin the people began to consider how change in technology were bringing change in the concept of privacy vance packards the naked society wa a popular book on privacy from that era and led u discourse on privacy at that time in addition alan westins privacy and freedom shifted the debate regarding privacy from a physical sense how the government control a person body ie roe v wade and other activity such a wiretapping and photography a important record became digitized westin argued that personal data wa becoming too accessible and that a person should have complete jurisdiction over their data laying the foundation for the modern discussion of privacynew technology can also create new way to gather private information in the legal case kyllo v united state u determined that the use of thermal imaging device that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant constitutes a violation of privacy in after developing a corporate rivalry in competing voicerecognition software apple and amazon required employee to listen to intimate moment and faithfully transcribe the content police and government police and citizen often conflict on what degree the police can intrude a citizen digital privacy for instance in the supreme court ruled unanimously in united state v jones u in the case of antoine jones who wa arrested of drug possession using a gps tracker on his car that wa placed without a warrant that warrantless tracking infringes the fourth amendment the supreme court also justified that there is some reasonable expectation of privacy in transportation since the reasonable expectation of privacy had already been established under griswold v connecticut the supreme court also further clarified that the fourth amendment did not only pertain to physical instance of intrusion but also digital instance and thus united state v jones became a landmark casein the supreme court ruled unanimously in riley v california u where david leon riley wa arrested after he wa pulled over for driving on expired license tag when the police searched his phone and discovered that he wa tied to a shooting that searching a citizen phone without a warrant wa an unreasonable search a violation of the fourth amendment the supreme court concluded that the cell phone contained personal information different from trivial item and went beyond to state that information stored on the cloud wa not necessarily a form of evidence riley v california evidently became a landmark case protecting the digital protection of citizen privacy when confronted with the policea recent notable occurrence of the conflict between law enforcement and a citizen in term of digital privacy ha been in the case carpenter v united state u in this case the fbi used cell phone record without a warrant to arrest timothy ivory carpenter on multiple charge and the supreme court ruled that the warrantless search of cell phone record violated the fourth amendment citing that the fourth amendment protects reasonable expectation of privacy and that information sent to third party still fall under data that can be included under reasonable expectation of privacybeyond law enforcement many interaction between the government and citizen have been revealed either lawfully or unlawfully specifically through whistleblower one notable example is edward snowden who released multiple operation related to the mass surveillance operation of the national security agency nsa where it wa discovered that the nsa continues to breach the security of million of people mainly through mass surveillance program whether it wa collecting great amount of data through third party private company hacking into other embassy or framework of international country and various breach of data which prompted a culture shock and stirred international debate related to digital privacy internet the internet and technology built on it enable new form of social interaction at increasingly faster speed and larger scale because the computer network which underlie the internet introduce such a wide range of novel security concern the discussion of privacy on the internet is often conflated with security indeed many entity such a corporation involved in the surveillance economy inculcate a securityfocused conceptualization of privacy which reduces their obligation to uphold privacy into a matter of regulatory compliance while at the same time lobbying to minimize those regulatory requirementshowever the internet effect on privacy also includes all of the way that computational technology and the entity which control it can subvert the privacy expectation of their user in particular the right to be forgotten is motivated by both the computational ability to store and search through massive amount of data a well a the subverted expectation of user who share information online without expecting it to be stored and retained indefinitely phenomenon such a revenge porn and deepfakes require both the ability to obtain image without someone consent a well a the social infrastructure to disseminate that content widely therefore privacy advocacy group such a the cyber civil right initiative and the electronic frontier foundation argue that addressing the new privacy harm introduced by the internet requires both technological improvement to encryption and anonymity a well a societal effort such a legal regulation to restrict corporate and government powerwhile the internet began a a government and academic effort up through the private corporation began to enclose the hardware and software of the internet in the and now most internet infrastructure is owned and managed by forprofit corporation a a result the ability of government to protect their citizen privacy is largely restricted to industrial policy instituting control on corporation that handle communication or personal data privacy regulation are often further constrained to only protect specific demographic such a child or specific industry such a credit card bureau social networking several online social network site osns are among the top most visited website globally facebook for example a of august wa the largest socialnetworking site with nearly billion member who upload over billion piece of content daily while twitter is significantly smaller with million registered user the u library of congress recently announced that it will be acquiring and permanently storing the entire archive of public twitter post since review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individual privacy of online social networking show the following result first adult seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threat than younger user second policy maker should be alarmed by a large part of user who underestimate risk of their information privacy on osns third in the case of using osns and it service traditional onedimensional privacy approach fall short this is exacerbated by deanonymization research indicating that personal trait such a sexual orientation race religious and political view personality or intelligence can be inferred based on a wide variety of digital footprint such a sample of text browsing log or facebook likesintrusions of social medium privacy are known to affect employment in the united state microsoft report that percent of u recruiter and humanresource professional now do online research about candidate often using information provided by search engine socialnetworking site photovideosharing site personal web site and blog and twitter they also report that percent of u recruiter have rejected candidate based on internet information this ha created a need by many candidate to control various online privacy setting in addition to controlling their online reputation the conjunction of which ha led to legal suit against both social medium site and u employer selfie culture selfies are popular today a search for photo with the hashtag selfie retrieves over million result on instagram and million with the hashtag me however due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance this may pose a risk to privacy in a research study which take a sample size of researcher found that for user posting selfies on social medium woman generally have greater concern over privacy than men and that user privacy concern inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity online harassment an invasion of someone privacy may be widely and quickly disseminated over the internet when social medium site and other online community fail to invest in content moderation an invasion of privacy can expose people to a much greater volume and degree of harassment than would otherwise be possible revenge porn may lead to misogynist or homophobic harassment such a in the suicide of amanda todd and the suicide of tyler clementi when someone physical location or other sensitive information is leaked over the internet via doxxing harassment may escalate to direct physical harm such a stalking or swatting despite the way breach of privacy can magnify online harassment online harassment is often used a a justification to curtail freedom of speech by removing the expectation of privacy via anonymity or by enabling law enforcement to invade privacy without a search warrant in the wake of amanda todd death the canadian parliament proposed a motion purporting to stop bullying but todd mother herself gave testimony to parliament rejecting the bill due to it provision for warrantless breach of privacy stating i dont want to see our child victimized again by losing privacy rightseven where these law have been passed despite privacy concern they have not demonstrated a reduction in online harassment when the korea communication commission introduced a registration system for online commenters in they reported that malicious comment only decreased by and in it wa repealed a subsequent analysis found that the set of user who posted the most comment actually increased the number of aggressive expression when forced to use their real namein the u while federal law only prohibits online harassment based on protected characteristic such a gender and race individual state have expanded the definition of harassment to further curtail speech florida definition of online harassment includes any use of data or computer software that ha the effect of substantially disrupting the orderly operation of a school privacy and locationbased service increasingly mobile device facilitate location tracking this creates user privacy problem a user location and preference constitute personal information and their improper use violates that user privacy a recent mit study by de montjoye et al showed that four spatiotemporal point constituting approximate place and time are enough to uniquely identify of people in a mobility database the study further show that these constraint hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low therefore even coarse or blurred datasets confer little privacy protectionseveral method to protect user privacy in locationbased service have been proposed including the use of anonymizing server and blurring of information method to quantify privacy have also been proposed to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of obtaining accurate location information and the risk of breaching an individual privacy ethical controversy over location privacy there have been scandal regarding location privacy one instance wa the scandal concerning accuweather where it wa revealed that accuweather wa selling locational data this consisted of a user locational data even if they opted out within accuweather which tracked user location accuweather sold this data to reveal mobile a company that monetizes data related to a user location other international case are similar to the accuweather case in a leaky api inside the mcdelivery app exposed private data which consisted of home address of million usersin the wake of these type of scandal many large american technology company such a google apple and facebook have been subjected to hearing and pressure under the u legislative system in u senator al franken wrote an open letter to steve job noting the ability of iphones and ipads to record and store user location in unencrypted file apple claimed this wa an unintentional software bug but justin brookman of the center for democracy and technology directly challenged that portrayal stating im glad that they are fixing what they call bug but i take exception with their strong denial that they track user in the u state of arizona found in a court case that google misled it user and stored the location of user regardless of their location setting advertising the internet ha become a significant medium for advertising with digital marketing making up approximately half of the global ad spending in while website are still able to sell advertising space without tracking including via contextual advertising digital ad broker such a facebook and google have instead encouraged the practice of behavioral advertising providing code snippet used by website owner to track their user via http cooky this tracking data is also sold to other third party a part of the mass surveillance industry since the introduction of mobile phone data broker have also been planted within apps resulting in a billion digital industry especially focused on mobile devicesdigital privacy ha become the main source of concern for many mobile user especially with the rise of privacy scandal such a the facebookcambridge analytica data scandal recently apple ha received positive press for feature that prohibit advertiser from tracking a user data without their consent while google attempted to introduce an alternative to cooky named floc which it claimed reduced the privacy harm it later retracted the proposal due to antitrust probe and analysis that contradicted their claim of privacy metadata the ability to do online inquiry about individual ha expanded dramatically over the last decade importantly directly observed behavior such a browsing log search query or content of a public facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual such a sexual orientation political and religious view race substance use intelligence and personality in australia the telecommunication interception and access amendment data retention act made a distinction between collecting the content of message sent between user and the metadata surrounding those message legal right to privacy most country give citizen right to privacy in their constitution representative example of this include the constitution of brazil which say the privacy private life honor and image of people are inviolable the constitution of south africa say that everyone ha a right to privacy and the constitution of the republic of korea say the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed the italian constitution also defines the right to privacy among most country whose constitution do not explicitly describe privacy right court decision have interpreted their constitution to intend to give privacy right many country have broad privacy law outside their constitution including australia privacy act argentina law for the protection of personal data of canada personal information protection and electronic document act and japan personal information protection lawbeyond national privacy law there are international privacy agreement the united nation universal declaration of human right say no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy family home or correspondence nor to attack upon their honor and reputation the organisation for economic cooperation and development published it privacy guideline in the european union data protection directive guide privacy protection in europe the privacy framework by the asiapacific economic cooperation is a privacy protection agreement for the member of that organization free market v consumer protection approach to privacy can broadly be divided into two category free market or consumer protectionone example of the free market approach is to be found in the voluntary oecd guideline on the protection of privacy and transborder flow of personal data the principle reflected in the guideline free of legislative interference are analyzed in an article putting them into perspective with concept of the gdpr put into law later in the european unionin a consumer protection approach in contrast it is claimed that individual may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choice or may not have reasonable alternative available in support of this view jensen and potts showed that most privacy policy are above the reading level of the average person by country australia the privacy act is administered by the office of the australian information commissioner the initial introduction of privacy law in extended to the public sector specifically to federal government department under the information privacy principle state government agency can also be subject to state based privacy legislation this built upon the already existing privacy requirement that applied to telecommunication provider under part of the telecommunication act and confidentiality requirement that already applied to banking legal and patient doctor relationshipsin the australian law reform commission alrc conducted a review of australian privacy law and produced a report titled for your information recommendation were taken up and implemented by the australian government via the privacy amendment enhancing privacy protection bill in the telecommunication interception and access amendment data retention act wa passed to some controversy over it human right implication and the role of medium european union in the european union passed the general data protection regulation gdpr which wa intended to reduce the misuse of personal data and enhance individual privacy by requiring company to receive consent before acquiring personal information from usersalthough there are comprehensive regulation for data protection in the european union one study find that despite the law there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feel responsible to control the party involved and enforce their law the european union also champion the right to be forgotten concept in support of it adoption by other country india since the introduction of the aadhaar project in which resulted in all billion indian being associated with a biometricsecured number aadhaar ha uplifted the poor in india by providing them with a form of identity and preventing the fraud and waste of resource a normally the government would not be able to allocate it resource to it intended assignee due to the id issue with the rise of aadhaar india ha debated whether aadhaar violates an individual privacy and whether any organization should have access to an individual digital profile a the aadhaar card became associated with other economic sector allowing for the tracking of individual by both public and private body aadhaar database have suffered from security attack a well and the project wa also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructure in where the aadhar wa challenged the indian supreme court declared privacy a a human right but postponed the decision regarding the constitutionality of aadhaar for another bench in september the indian supreme court determined that the aadhaar project did not violate the legal right to privacy united kingdom in the united kingdom it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy an action may be brought under another tort usually breach of confidence and privacy must then be considered under ec law in the uk it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information wa in the public interest there is however the information commissioner office ico an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information they do this by promoting good practice ruling on eligible complaint giving information to individual and organisation and taking action when the law is broken the relevant uk law include data protection act freedom of information act environmental information regulation privacy and electronic communication regulation the ico ha also provided a personal information toolkit online which explains in more detail the various way of protecting privacy online united state although the u constitution doe not explicitly include the right to privacy individual a well a locational privacy may be implicitly granted by the constitution under the amendment the supreme court of the united state ha found that other guarantee have penumbra that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion for example in griswold v connecticut and roe v wade dobbs v jackson woman health organization later overruled roe v wade with supreme court justice clarence thomas characterizing griswolds penumbral argument a having a facial absurdity casting doubt on the validity of a constitutional right to privacy in the united state and of previous decision relying on it in the united state the right of freedom of speech granted in the first amendment ha limited the effect of lawsuit for breach of privacy privacy is regulated in the u by the privacy act of and various state law the privacy act of only applies to federal agency in the executive branch of the federal government certain privacy right have been established in the united state via legislation such a the childrens online privacy protection act coppa the grammleachbliley act glb and the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa unlike the eu and most eumember state the u doe not recognize the right to privacy of nonus citizen the un special rapporteur on the right to privacy joseph a cannataci criticized this distinction conception of privacy privacy a contextual integrity the theory of contextual integrity developed by helen nissenbaum defines privacy a an appropriate information flow where appropriateness in turn is defined a conformance with legitimate informational norm specific to social context right to be let alone in the united state jurist samuel d warren and louis brandeis wrote the right to privacy an article in which they argued for the right to be let alone using that phrase a a definition of privacy this concept relies on the theory of natural right and focus on protecting individual the citation wa a response to recent technological development such a photography and sensationalist journalism also known a yellow journalismthere is extensive commentary over the meaning of being let alone and among other way it ha been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private setting such a one own home although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protection of privacy it strengthened the notion of privacy right for individual and began a legacy of discussion on those right in the u limited access limited access refers to a person ability to participate in society without having other individual and organization collect information about themvarious theorist have imagined privacy a a system for limiting access to one personal information edwin lawrence godkin wrote in the late century that nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life or in other word the right of every man to keep his affair to himself and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion adopting an approach similar to the one presented by ruth gavison nine year earlier sissela bok said that privacy is the condition of being protected from unwanted access by otherseither physical access personal information or attention control over information control over one personal information is the concept that privacy is the claim of individual group or institution to determine for themselves when how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others generally a person who ha consensually formed an interpersonal relationship with another person is not considered protected by privacy right with respect to the person they are in the relationship with charles fried said that privacy is not simply an absence of information about u in the mind of others rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves nevertheless in the era of big data control over information is under pressure state of privacy alan westin defined four statesor experiencesof privacy solitude intimacy anonymity and reserve solitude is a physical separation from others intimacy is a close relaxed and frank relationship between two or more individual that result from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individual anonymity is the desire of individual for time of public privacy lastly reserve is the creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning themselfin addition to the psychological barrier of reserve kirsty hughes identified three more kind of privacy barrier physical behavioral and normative physical barrier such a wall and door prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual in this sense accessing an individual includes accessing personal information about them behavioral barrier communicate to othersverbally through language or nonverbally through personal space body language or clothingthat an individual doe not want the other person to access or experience them lastly normative barrier such a law and social norm restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual secrecy privacy is sometimes defined a an option to have secrecy richard posner said that privacy is the right of people to conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantagein various legal context when privacy is described a secrecy a conclusion is reached if privacy is secrecy then right to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed when privacyassecrecy is discussed it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individual keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private personhood and autonomy privacy may be understood a a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood jeffrey reiman defined privacy in term of a recognition of one ownership of their physical and mental reality and a moral right to selfdetermination through the social ritual of privacy or the social practice of respecting an individual privacy barrier the social group communicates to developing child that they have exclusive moral right to their bodiesin other word moral ownership of their body this entail control over both active physical and cognitive appropriation the former being control over one movement and action and the latter being control over who can experience one physical existence and whenalternatively stanley benn defined privacy in term of a recognition of oneself a a subject with agencyas an individual with the capacity to choose privacy is required to exercise choice overt observation make the individual aware of himself or herself a an object with a determinate character and limited probability covert observation on the other hand change the condition in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consentin addition privacy may be viewed a a state that enables autonomy a concept closely connected to that of personhood according to joseph kufer an autonomous selfconcept entail a conception of oneself a a purposeful selfdetermining responsible agent and an awareness of one capacity to control the boundary between self and otherthat is to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent furthermore others must acknowledge and respect the self boundariesin other word they must respect the individual privacythe study of psychologist such a jean piaget and victor tausk show that a child learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent they develop an autonomous selfconcept in addition study of adult in particular institution such a erving goffmans study of total institution such a prison and mental institution suggest that systemic and routinized deprivation or violation of privacy deteriorate one sense of autonomy over time selfidentity and personal growth privacy may be understood a a prerequisite for the development of a sense of selfidentity privacy barrier in particular are instrumental in this process according to irwin altman such barrier define and limit the boundary of the self and thus serve to help define the self this control primarily entail the ability to regulate contact with others control over the permeability of the self boundary enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the selfin addition privacy may be seen a a state that foster personal growth a process integral to the development of selfidentity hyman gross suggested that without privacysolitude anonymity and temporary release from social rolesindividuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in selfdiscovery and selfcriticism such selfdiscovery and selfcriticism contributes to one understanding of oneself and shape one sense of identity intimacy in a way analogous to how the personhood theory imago privacy a some essential part of being an individual the intimacy theory imago privacy to be an essential part of the way that human have strengthened or intimate relationship with other human because part of human relationship includes individual volunteering to selfdisclose most if not all personal information this is one area in which privacy doe not applyjames rachel advanced this notion by writing that privacy matter because there is a close connection between our ability to control who ha access to u and to information about u and our ability to create and maintain different sort of social relationship with different people protecting intimacy is at the core of the concept of sexual privacy which law professor danielle citron argues should be protected a a unique form of privacy physical privacy physical privacy could be defined a preventing intrusion into one physical space or solitude an example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the u fourth amendment which guarantee the right of the people to be secure in their person house paper and effect against unreasonable search and seizuresphysical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity personal dignity andor shyness there may also be concern about safety if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking there are different thing that can be prevented to protect one physical privacy including people watching even through recorded image one intimate behaviour or body part and unhautorized access to one personal possession or place example of possible effort used to avoid the former especially for modesty reason are clothes wall fence privacy screen cathedral glass window covering etc organizational government agency corporation groupssocieties and other organization may desire to keep their activity or secret from being revealed to other organization or individual adopting various security practice and control in order to keep private information confidential organization may seek legal protection for their secret for example a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege or declare certain information to be classified or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information a trade secret privacy selfsynchronization privacy selfsynchronization is a hypothesized mode by which the stakeholder of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program maximum success the stakeholder may be customer employee manager executive supplier partner or investor when selfsynchronization is reached the model state that the personal interest of individual toward their privacy is in balance with the business interest of enterprise who collect and use the personal information of those individual an individual right david flaherty belief networked computer database pose threat to privacy he develops data protection a an aspect of privacy which involves the collection use and dissemination of personal information this concept form the foundation for fair information practice used by government globally flaherty forward an idea of privacy a information control individual want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is usedrichard posner and lawrence lessig focus on the economic aspect of personal information control posner criticizes privacy for concealing information which reduces market efficiency for posner employment is selling oneself in the labour market which he belief is like selling a product any defect in the product that is not reported is fraud for lessig privacy breach online can be regulated through code and law lessig claim the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right a a property right and that individual should be able to control information about themselves a collective value and a human right there have been attempt to establish privacy a one of the fundamental human right whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societiespriscilla regan belief that individual concept of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy she support a social value of privacy with three dimension shared perception public value and collective component shared idea about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought public value guarantee democratic participation including freedom of speech and association and limit government power collective element describe privacy a collective good that can not be divided regans goal is to strengthen privacy claim in policy making if we did recognize the collective or publicgood value of privacy a well a the common and public value of privacy those advocating privacy protection would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for it protectionleslie regan shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation and ensures human dignity and autonomy privacy depends on norm for how information is distributed and if this is appropriate violation of privacy depend on context the human right to privacy ha precedent in the united nation declaration of human right everyone ha the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinion without interference and to seek receive and impart information and idea through any medium and regardless of frontier shade belief that privacy must be approached from a peoplecentered perspective and not through the marketplacedr eliza watt westminster law school university of westminster in london uk proposes application of the international human right law ihrl concept of virtual control a an approach to deal with extraterritorial mass surveillance by state intelligence agency dr watt envisions the virtual control test understood a a remote control over the individual right to privacy of communication where privacy is recognized under the iccpr article this she contends may help to close the normative gap that is being exploited by nation state privacy paradox and economic valuation the privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online user state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave a if they were not while this term wa coined a early a it wa not used in it current popular sense until the year b barnes similarly used the term privacy paradox to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social medium when compared to adult young people tend to disclose more information on social medium however this doe not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy susan b barnes gave a case in her article in a television interview about facebook a student addressed her concern about disclosing personal information online however when the reporter asked to see her facebook page she put her home address phone number and picture of her young son on the page the privacy paradox ha been studied and scripted in different research setting several study have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitude and behavior among online user however by now an increasing number of study have also shown that there are significant and at time large correlation between privacy concern and information sharing behavior which speaks against the privacy paradox a metaanalysis of study published on the topic reported an overall small but significant relation between privacy concern and information sharing or use of privacy protection measure so although there are several individual instance or anecdote where behavior appear paradoxical on average privacy concern and privacy behavior seem to be related and several finding question the general existence of the privacy paradoxhowever the relationship between concern and behavior is likely only small and there are several argument that can explain why that is the case according to the attitudebehavior gap attitude and behavior are in general and in most case not closely related a main explanation for the partial mismatch in the context of privacy specifically is that user lack awareness of the risk and the degree of protection user may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online on the other hand some researcher argue that the mismatch come from lack of technology literacy and from the design of site for example user may not know how to change their default setting even though they care about their privacy psychologist sonja utz and nicole c krmer particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox can occur when user must tradeoff between their privacy concern and impression management research on irrational decision making a study conducted by susanne barth and menno dt de jo demonstrates that decision making take place on an irrational level especially when it come to mobile computing mobile application in particular are often built up in such a way that spur decision making that is fast and automatic without assessing risk factor protection measure against these unconscious mechanism are often difficult to access while downloading and installing apps even with mechanism in place to protect user privacy user may not have the knowledge or experience to enable these mechanismsusers of mobile application generally have very little knowledge of how their personal data are used when they decide which application to download they typically are not able to effectively interpret the information provided by application vendor regarding the collection and use of personal data other research find that this lack of interpretability mean user are much more likely to be swayed by cost functionality design rating review and number of downloads than requested permission for usage of their personal data the economic valuation of privacy the willingness to incur a privacy risk is suspected to be driven by a complex array of factor including risk attitude personal value for private information and general attitude to privacy which are typically measured using survey one experiment aiming to determine the monetary value of several type of personal information indicated relatively low evaluation of personal information despite claim that ascertaining the value of data requires a stockmarket for personal information surveillance capitalism and the mass surveillance industry regularly place price tag on this form of data a it is shared between corporation and government information asymmetry user are not always given the tool to live up to their professed privacy concern and they are sometimes willing to trade private information for convenience functionality or financial gain even when the gain are very small one study suggests that people think their browser history is worth the equivalent of a cheap meal another find that attitude to privacy risk do not appear to depend on whether it is already under threat or not the methodology of user empowerment describes how to provide user with sufficient context to make privacyinformed decision inherent necessity for privacy violation it is suggested by andra belliger and david j krieger that the privacy paradox should not be considered a paradox but more of a privacy dilemma for service that can not exist without the user sharing private data however the general public is typically not given the choice whether to share private data or not making it difficult to verify any claim that a service truly can not exist without sharing private data privacy calculus model the privacy calculus model posit that two factor determine privacy behavior namely privacy concern or perceived risk and expected benefit by now the privacy calculus ha been supported by several study action which reduce privacy a with other conception of privacy there are various way to discus what kind of process or action remove challenge lessen or attack privacy in legal scholar william prosser created the following list of activity which can be remedied with privacy protection intrusion into a person private space own affair or wish for solitude public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect belief about them encroaching someone personality right and using their likeness to advance interest which are not their ownfrom to building from this and other historical precedent daniel j solove presented another classification of action which are harmful to privacy including collection of information which is already somewhat public processing of information sharing information and invading personal space to get private information collecting information in the context of harming privacy information collection mean gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it example include surveillance and interrogation another example is how consumer and marketer also collect information in the business context through facial recognition which ha recently caused a concern for thing such a privacy there is currently research being done related to this topic aggregating information it can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available but that the harm can come when that information is collected a a set then processed together in such a way that the collective reporting of piece of information encroaches on privacy action in this category which can lessen privacy include the following data aggregation which is connecting many related but unconnected piece of information identification which can mean breaking the deidentification of item of data by putting it through a deanonymization process thus making fact which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people insecurity such a lack of data security which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a data breach which harm the people whose data it held secondary use which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose but then the data is used in way without the data donor informed consent exclusion is the use of a person data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in it usage information dissemination count not him among your friend who will retail your privacy to the world information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which wa shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harm the subject of the informationthere are various example of this breach of confidentiality is when one entity promise to keep a person information private then break that promise disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harm the subject of the information regardless of how the information wa collected or the intent of making it available exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share such a revealing their private life experience their nudity or perhaps private body function increased accessibility mean advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it a in the case of doxxing blackmail is making a threat to share information perhaps a part of an effort to coerce someone appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone and can include using the value of someone reputation or likeness to advance interest which are not those of the person being appropriated distortion is the creation of misleading information or lie about a person invasion invasion of privacy a subset of expectation of privacy is a different concept from the collecting aggregating and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individual to keep personal secret an invasion is an attack in which information whether intended to be public or not is captured in a way that insult the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken intrusion an intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person private personal space and solitude for any reason regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space decisional interference is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decisionmaking process of another person perhaps to influence that person private decision but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thought that a person ha example of invasion of privacy in contract worker for apple and amazon reported being forced to continue listening to intimate moment captured on the company smart speaker in order to improve the quality of their automated speech recognition software technique to improve privacy similarly to action which reduce privacy there are multiple angle of privacy and multiple technique to improve them to varying extent when action are done at an organizational level they may be referred to a cybersecurity encryption individual can encrypt email via enabling either two encryption protocol smime which is built into company like apple or outlook and thus most common or pgp the signal messaging app which encrypts message so that only the recipient can read the message is notable for being available on many mobile device and implementing a form of perfect forward secrecy anonymity anonymizing proxy or anonymizing network like and tor can be used to prevent internet service provider isp from knowing which site one visit and with whom one communicates by hiding ip address and location but doe not necessarily protect a user from third party data mining anonymizing proxy are built into a user device in comparison to a virtual private network vpn where user must download software using a vpn hide all data and connection that are exchanged between server and a user computer resulting in the online data of the user being unshared and secure providing a barrier between the user and their isp and is especially important to use when a user is connected to public wifi however user should understand that all their data doe flow through the vpns server rather than the isp user should decide for themselves if they wish to use either an anonymizing proxy or a vpn in a more nontechnical sense using incognito mode or private browsing mode will prevent a user computer from saving history internet file and cooky but the isp will still have access to the user search history using anonymous search engine will not share a user history click and will obstruct ad blocker user empowerment concrete solution on how to solve paradoxical behavior still do not exist many effort are focused on process of decision making like restricting data access permission during application installation but this would not completely bridge the gap between user intention and behavior susanne barth and menno dt de jong believe that for user to make more conscious decision on privacy matter the design need to be more useroriented other security measure in a social sense simply limiting the amount of personal information that user post on social medium could increase their security which in turn make it harder for criminal to perform identity theft moreover creating a set of complex password and using twofactor authentication can allow user to be le susceptible to their account being compromised when various data leak occur furthermore user should protect their digital privacy by using antivirus software which can block harmful virus like a popup scanning for personal information on a user computer legal method although there are law that promote the protection of user in some country like the u there is no federal digital privacy law and privacy setting are essentially limited by the state of current enacted privacy law to further their privacy user can start conversing with representative letting representative know that privacy is a main concern which in turn increase the likelihood of further privacy law being enacted privacy in nonhuman animal david attenborough a biologist and natural historian affirmed that gorilla value their privacy while discussing a brief escape by a gorilla in
